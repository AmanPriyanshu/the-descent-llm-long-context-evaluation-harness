# The-Descent: LLM long-context evaluation harness
The-Descent aims to evaluate long-context capabilities across varying information density regimes using benchmarks with constant (S-NIAH), linear (OOLONG), and quadratic (OOLONG-Pairs) complexity scaling, following the evaluation framework from Zhang et al. (2025).
