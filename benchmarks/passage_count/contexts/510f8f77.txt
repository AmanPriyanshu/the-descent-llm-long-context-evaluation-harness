Paragraph 1: Also effective in 2006, the Connector Board set premium levels and copayments for the state subsidized Commonwealth Care plans. Premiums will vary from $18 per month, for individuals with incomes 100–150% of the poverty line, to $106 per month for individuals with incomes 250–300% of poverty. The Connector approved two copayment schemes for plans for people 200–300% of poverty. One plan will have higher premiums and lower copayments, while a second choice will have lower premiums and higher copayments. Four managed care plans began offering Commonwealth Care on November 1, 2006. Coverage for people above 100% of poverty up to 300% of poverty began on February 1, 2007. As of December 1, 2007, around 158,000 people had been enrolled in Commonwealth Care plans. Initial bids received by the Connector showed a likely cost for the minimum insurance plan of about $380 per month. The Connector rejected those bids, and asked insurers to propose less expensive plans. New bids were announced on March 3, 2007. The Governor announced that "the average uninsured Massachusetts resident will be able to purchase health insurance for $175 per month." But plan costs will vary greatly depending on the plan selected, age and geographic location, ranging from just over $100 per month for plans for young adults with high copayments and deductibles to nearly $900 per month for comprehensive plans for older adults with low deductibles and copayments. Copayments, deductibles and out-of-pocket contributions may vary among plans. The proposed minimum creditable coverage plan would have a deductible no higher than $2,000 per individual, $4,000 per family, and would limit out-of-pocket expenses to a $5,000 maximum for an individual and $7,500 for a family. Before the deductible applies, the proposed plan includes preventive office visits with higher copayments, but would not include emergency room visits if the person was not admitted.

Paragraph 2: The High School's Marching band is part of the Western Band Association, which is based in California. The Band competes in the AA and AAA categories. In 1997, the LAHS Marching Band received six awards at the state festival.  In 2008, the band won its first sweepstakes award in four years, placing 7th out of 48 participating bands at Western Band's state preliminaries. In 2011-2012, the Band's show, "Forbidden", won numerous awards at local competitions, finished 6th statewide at the WBA State Championships in Thousand Oaks, CA, and captured the State's AAA High Music caption award for the first time in school history  In that same year, the band won a total of fifteen trophies and were undefeated in music throughout the entire season. The band's 2012 AA show was entitled "Senses" and their 2013 AAA show "REM."  The 2014 AAA show was entitled "House of Cards" and won 1st place at both Gilroy High School and Quest Classic competitions. In 2014, for the first time, the LAHS Marching Band competed in Bands of America regional championships, placing 3rd place in the AAA category. The band's AA show from 2015 was entitled "Muse". In 2015, the band came in 3rd place in the AA category at the Western Band Association 1A-2A-3A Class Championships, earning a spot to compete in the 1A-2A-3A Combined Grand Championships. The band went on to place 8th overall in the combined class championships. The band's 2016 AAA show was entitled "Deja Vu" and their 2017 AA show "Vertigo." The band's 2018 AA show was entitled "Mirage". The band's AA show from 2019 was entitled "Les Plumes". In 2019, the band came in 4th place in the AA category at the Western Band Association 1A-2A-3A Class Championships, earning a spot to compete in the 1A-2A-3A Combined Grand Championships. The band went on to place 18th overall in the combined class championships. There was no show in 2020. The band's 2021 A show was entitled "Masquerade" and their 2022 A show "DreamZzzz."

Paragraph 6: It was during that period that she and Investigative Judge Giovanni Falcone uncovered the link between Swiss money launderers and the Italian drug trade in the so-called "pizza connection." Judge Falcone was killed by a large Mafia bomb. Del Ponte was more fortunate as the half a tonne of explosives planted in the foundations of her Palermo home were discovered in time for her to escape the attempted assassination unhurt. Falcone's death nurtured Del Ponte's resolve to fight organised crime. Her enemies in the Cosa Nostra call her "La Puttana" ("the whore"). She therefore became the first public figure in Switzerland to require round-the-clock protection and armour-plated car.

Paragraph 7: In 1808, six years after the formal founding of the academy, Congress authorized the expansion of the Corps of Cadets from only a handful to nearly 300.  Along with this increase in personnel came the funding to house them.  The first formal set of barracks were constructed in 1815 and 1817 and were known as North and South Barracks.  These structures housed the Corps of Cadets until they were replaced and demolished in the early 1850s.  The main academic building, known simply as "the Academy", was also constructed in 1815.  These three buildings are depicted in the 1828 painting by George Catlin to the left.  On 19 February 1838, a fire destroyed the original academic building and most of the academy's records. The replacement of the original "academy", was constructed on the site of present-day Pershing Barracks in 1839 and remained in use until 1891. This academic building was three levels tall and multipurpose, with a large open floor plan on the ground floor that doubled as a riding hall during the winter months. In 1829, the West Point Hotel was built on the eastern edge of Trophy Point.  The hotel would stand overlooking the Hudson River for a century until it was demolished in the early 1930s, several years after the construction of the Thayer Hotel.  In 1841, superintendent Richard Delafield oversaw the construction of the old cadet library and observatory, which stood at the intersection of Cullum Road and Jefferson Place near present-day Cullum Hall and the second cadet library.  That library stood on the southern edge of the Plain for 119 years before it was demolished in 1960.  That library was built in the style known as Tudor Gothic and helped set the tone of future buildings on the edge of the plain.  The offices of the Superintendent, Adjutant, Quartermaster, & Treasurer were in the library until the new Headquarters was built in 1870. The old library's observatory had to be moved up the hill near Lusk Reservoir when a train tunnel was constructed under the Plain in 1880.  The observatory stood at the top of the hill above the cadet chapel until it was closed and demolished in the 1950s.  In 1851, Delafield oversaw a major overhaul in the barracks conditions with the construction of more modern barracks, built in the "division" style that is still prevalent in the older remaining barracks on post.  These barracks, known as "Old Central Barracks" remained in use for over 100 years before being demolished in the 1960s.  Today, only the 1st Division remains, standing as a monument in the cadet central area, preserved as "Nininger Hall", which houses the Cadet Honor Committee.  The "Old Cadet Mess Hall" was built on the site of the current Grant Hall in 1852 and served as the dining hall for the Corps of Cadets until it was replaced by Washington Hall and demolished in 1930 to make way for the current Grant Hall. In 1852, Delafield oversaw the construction of the Commandant's headquarter's building and cadet guardhouse on the site of present-day Bradley Barracks.  This building helped encircle the cadet "central area", which is similar to the courtyard known in present-day as "Central Area".  The Commandant's office was demolished in 1920. The Commandant's offices are on the 4th floor of Washington Hall overlooking the Plain.  On the site of present-day Thayer Hall, on the lower rises of the cliffs along the Hudson, the Old Riding Hall was constructed beginning in 1855.  The structure was known as the largest equestrian riding hall in the US during its day. This hall stood on the cliff below the Plain until being demolished for a new riding hall in 1908. In 1870, the new academy headquarters building was constructed on the site of present-day Taylor Hall.  Meant to house the Superintendent and other academy leadership and staff, this building was too small and inadequate shortly after construction and it was demolished shortly after 1900 to make way for the construction of Taylor Hall. A cadet hospital was constructed in 1884 on the site of present-day Lee Barracks.  In 1923, a new wing of the hospital was built, which now houses the Office of Admissions.  The main hospital building was demolished in 1960 to make way for Lee Barracks. In the late 1880s Richard Morris Hunt was contracted to design several buildings.  The first was a gymnasium, begun in 1891 in a Romanesque Revival design with two large towers flanking a grand arched entrance.  The gymnasium was opened in 1893 and used until the early 1920s, when it was demolished to make way for the new mess hall, Washington Hall.

Paragraph 8: It was during that period that she and Investigative Judge Giovanni Falcone uncovered the link between Swiss money launderers and the Italian drug trade in the so-called "pizza connection." Judge Falcone was killed by a large Mafia bomb. Del Ponte was more fortunate as the half a tonne of explosives planted in the foundations of her Palermo home were discovered in time for her to escape the attempted assassination unhurt.

Paragraph 15: It was during that period that she and Investigative Judge Giovanni Falcone uncovered the link between Swiss money launderers and the Italian drug trade in the so-called "pizza connection." Judge Falcone was killed by a large Mafia bomb. Del Ponte was more fortunate as the half a tonne of explosives planted in the foundations of her Palermo home were discovered in time for her to escape the attempted assassination unhurt. Falcone's death nurtured Del Ponte's resolve to fight organised crime. Her enemies in the Cosa Nostra call her "La Puttana" ("the whore"). She therefore became the first public figure in Switzerland to require round-the-clock protection and armour-plated car.

Paragraph 17: Also effective in 2006, the Connector Board set premium levels and copayments for the state subsidized Commonwealth Care plans. Premiums will vary from $18 per month, for individuals with incomes 100–150% of the poverty line, to $106 per month for individuals with incomes 250–300% of poverty. The Connector approved two copayment schemes for plans for people 200–300% of poverty. One plan will have higher premiums and lower copayments, while a second choice will have lower premiums and higher copayments. Four managed care plans began offering Commonwealth Care on November 1, 2006. Coverage for people above 100% of poverty up to 300% of poverty began on February 1, 2007. As of December 1, 2007, around 158,000 people had been enrolled in Commonwealth Care plans. Initial bids received by the Connector showed a likely cost for the minimum insurance plan of about $380 per month. The Connector rejected those bids, and asked insurers to propose less expensive plans. New bids were announced on March 3, 2007. The Governor announced that "the average uninsured Massachusetts resident will be able to purchase health insurance for $175 per month." But plan costs will vary greatly depending on the plan selected, age and geographic location, ranging from just over $100 per month for plans for young adults with high copayments and deductibles to nearly $900 per month for comprehensive plans for older adults with low deductibles and copayments. Copayments, deductibles and out-of-pocket contributions may vary among plans. The proposed minimum creditable coverage plan would have a deductible no higher than $2,000 per individual, $4,000 per family, and would limit out-of-pocket expenses to a $5,000 maximum for an individual and $7,500 for a family. Before the deductible applies, the proposed plan includes preventive office visits with higher copayments, but would not include emergency room visits if the person was not admitted.

Paragraph 21: In 1808, six years after the formal founding of the academy, Congress authorized the expansion of the Corps of Cadets from only a handful to nearly 300.  Along with this increase in personnel came the funding to house them.  The first formal set of barracks were constructed in 1815 and 1817 and were known as North and South Barracks.  These structures housed the Corps of Cadets until they were replaced and demolished in the early 1850s.  The main academic building, known simply as "the Academy", was also constructed in 1815.  These three buildings are depicted in the 1828 painting by George Catlin to the left.  On 19 February 1838, a fire destroyed the original academic building and most of the academy's records. The replacement of the original "academy", was constructed on the site of present-day Pershing Barracks in 1839 and remained in use until 1891. This academic building was three levels tall and multipurpose, with a large open floor plan on the ground floor that doubled as a riding hall during the winter months. In 1829, the West Point Hotel was built on the eastern edge of Trophy Point.  The hotel would stand overlooking the Hudson River for a century until it was demolished in the early 1930s, several years after the construction of the Thayer Hotel.  In 1841, superintendent Richard Delafield oversaw the construction of the old cadet library and observatory, which stood at the intersection of Cullum Road and Jefferson Place near present-day Cullum Hall and the second cadet library.  That library stood on the southern edge of the Plain for 119 years before it was demolished in 1960.  That library was built in the style known as Tudor Gothic and helped set the tone of future buildings on the edge of the plain.  The offices of the Superintendent, Adjutant, Quartermaster, & Treasurer were in the library until the new Headquarters was built in 1870. The old library's observatory had to be moved up the hill near Lusk Reservoir when a train tunnel was constructed under the Plain in 1880.  The observatory stood at the top of the hill above the cadet chapel until it was closed and demolished in the 1950s.  In 1851, Delafield oversaw a major overhaul in the barracks conditions with the construction of more modern barracks, built in the "division" style that is still prevalent in the older remaining barracks on post.  These barracks, known as "Old Central Barracks" remained in use for over 100 years before being demolished in the 1960s.  Today, only the 1st Division remains, standing as a monument in the cadet central area, preserved as "Nininger Hall", which houses the Cadet Honor Committee.  The "Old Cadet Mess Hall" was built on the site of the current Grant Hall in 1852 and served as the dining hall for the Corps of Cadets until it was replaced by Washington Hall and demolished in 1930 to make way for the current Grant Hall. In 1852, Delafield oversaw the construction of the Commandant's headquarter's building and cadet guardhouse on the site of present-day Bradley Barracks.  This building helped encircle the cadet "central area", which is similar to the courtyard known in present-day as "Central Area".  The Commandant's office was demolished in 1920. The Commandant's offices are on the 4th floor of Washington Hall overlooking the Plain.  On the site of present-day Thayer Hall, on the lower rises of the cliffs along the Hudson, the Old Riding Hall was constructed beginning in 1855.  The structure was known as the largest equestrian riding hall in the US during its day. This hall stood on the cliff below the Plain until being demolished for a new riding hall in 1908. In 1870, the new academy headquarters building was constructed on the site of present-day Taylor Hall.  Meant to house the Superintendent and other academy leadership and staff, this building was too small and inadequate shortly after construction and it was demolished shortly after 1900 to make way for the construction of Taylor Hall. A cadet hospital was constructed in 1884 on the site of present-day Lee Barracks.  In 1923, a new wing of the hospital was built, which now houses the Office of Admissions.  The main hospital building was demolished in 1960 to make way for Lee Barracks. In the late 1880s Richard Morris Hunt was contracted to design several buildings.  The first was a gymnasium, begun in 1891 in a Romanesque Revival design with two large towers flanking a grand arched entrance.  The gymnasium was opened in 1893 and used until the early 1920s, when it was demolished to make way for the new mess hall, Washington Hall.
