Paragraph 1: Greene beat Martin O'Donnell 5–3 to qualify for the first ranking event of the 2013–14 season, the Wuxi Classic. At the venue he saw off Michael Wasley 5–1, before losing 5–2 to David Morris in the second round. Greene reached his first final after 20 years as a professional at the minor-ranking Paul Hunter Classic in August. He won four matches to reach the quarter-finals where he beat Joe Swail 4–1, then held his nerve against Ali Carter to win 4–3 after leading 3–0. In the final he faced Ronnie O'Sullivan and was defeated 4–0 in 44 minutes. He secured the highest break in the qualifying rounds of the International Championships, a break of 142 in a 6–5 defeat to Thepchaiya Un-Nooh. At the Ruhr Open Greene made the highest break of his professional career, a 144 in a 4–0 first round win over Germany's Phil Barnes. Greene went on to beat Nigel Bond 4–2 and then lost 4–2 to Anthony Hamilton in the last 32. His season seemed to be heading for an anti-climax as he could not win more than one match in any event until he played in the PTC Finals. His aforementioned final saw him finish 17th on the Order of Merit to qualify and he then defeated Ricky Walden 4–1 and came from 3–0 down against Anthony Hamilton to triumph 4–3. The wins kept on coming for Greene as he knocked out number one seed Mark Allen 4–2 and Marco Fu 4–2 to play in his first ranking event final. After his semi-final match with Fu, Greene stated that the week had made him feel like a professional snooker player for the first time in two years as he had been playing well against the top players. He played practice partner Barry Hawkins in the final and did not pot a ball in the first two frames and went on to be beaten 4–0, but the £38,000 runner-up's cheque is the biggest of his career to date. It also helped him climb 12 spots in the rankings to end the season as the world number 44.

Paragraph 2: Maraging steels (a portmanteau of "martensitic" and "aging") are steels that are known for possessing superior strength and toughness without losing ductility. Aging refers to the extended heat-treatment process. These steels are a special class of very-low-carbon ultra-high-strength steels that derive their strength not from carbon, but from precipitation of intermetallic compounds. The principal alloying element is 15 to 25 wt% nickel. Secondary alloying elements, which include cobalt, molybdenum and titanium, are added to produce intermetallic precipitates. Original development (by Bieber of Inco in the late 1950s) was carried out on 20 and 25 wt% Ni steels to which small additions of aluminium, titanium, and niobium were made; a rise in the price of cobalt in the late 1970s led to the development of cobalt-free maraging steels.

Paragraph 3: Soon after 1680 Young managed to procure admission to deacon's orders at the hands of John Roan, Bishop of Killaloe, whom he circumvented by forging certificates of his learning and moral character. He obtained a curacy first at Tallogh in the county of Waterford, "whence for divers crimes he ran away on another man's horse, which he never restored". From his next curacy at Castlereagh, Co. Roscommon, he "was forced to flee for getting a bastard". While at Kildallon in the diocese of Kilmore he was delated to the bishop, Francis Marsh, afterwards Archbishop of Dublin, "for many extravagances, the least of which was marrying without banns or license". He now fled into the diocese of Raphoe, but was taken up for bigamy and imprisoned first at Lifford, then at Cavan. From gaol he wrote to both his wives, comparing himself to David, and assuring each of them that she alone was the object of his love. He succeeded in inducing his first wife not to appear against him, and seems to have been allowed benefit of clergy. Detained for non-payment of prison fees, he managed to procure his release by pretending to Ormonde (the "Popish Plot" being then in the air) that he could make disclosure of serious plots against the government. "The Scotchman", as Marsh calls him in a letter to Bishop Sprat, then ran away to England with his second wife. In England they operated at first under the name of Green, perambulating the country with forged testimonials, purporting to be in the hand of the archbishop of Canterbury. At Bury St. Edmunds, on 6 October 1684, they were pilloried as common cheats. From Bury gaol, on 30 September 1684, Young had written a long letter to Archbishop Sancroft, with an entirely novel account of his parentage and early life, expressing his mortal hatred of "discentors, especially that damnable faction of Presbytery", and stating that he had been put upon "the hellish and durty stratageme" of forging testimonials by one Wright, a non-existent "scrivener of Oxford". Failing in his object, he vowed to be revenged on the archbishop. As soon as he was released he forged a new set of testimonials with a dexterity which was generally admitted to be marvellous, and set to work, with a new alias and a new story, collecting large sums of money from wealthy clergymen, including three bishops who were intimate with Sancroft, and believed that they recognised his hand. At length in 1687 the imposture came under the notice of the archbishop, who caused to be inserted in the London Gazette (September and October 1687) advertisements warning the charitable to beware of Mrs. Jones and Robert Smith (i.e. Young and his paramour). Young next gave himself out as a grave Irish clergyman of good preferment, but a victim of Tyrconnel's persecuting fury; some funds were necessary to support this character, and these he seems to have obtained by a series of highly successful frauds at St. Albans, where he had secured the corrupt connivance of the postmaster. Forming a design of a wealthy marriage, Young was now anxious to get rid of Mary Hutt; but at this juncture the pair were betrayed to one of their victims, and lodged in Newgate on a charge of forgery. They escaped with the pillory and a fine, owing to lack of evidence; but, the fines remaining unpaid until 25 May 1692, they remained in prison for upwards of two years.

Detained for non-payment of prison fees, he managed to procure his release by pretending to Ormonde (the "Popish Plot" being then in the air) that he could make disclosure of serious plots against the government. "The Scotchman", as Marsh calls him in a letter to Bishop Sprat, then ran away to England with his second wife.

Paragraph 5: While the movie was based on the controversy surrounding Arthur Godfrey, whose tabloid real-life persona contrasted with his warm-hearted public demeanor, the fictional Fuller's failings differed greatly. Godfrey's controversies were mostly public, not private. His early years in broadcasting in Baltimore, Washington DC and New York City were largely noncontroversial, marked mainly by favorable public reaction to his informality on the air and his extemporized, irreverent commercials. The term "the Fuller Family" used in the film was based on the umbrella term "Little Godfreys" applied to his cast.  Godfrey's womanizing was long-rumored but never confirmed, and he was not a heavy drinker like Fuller. While Fuller was depicted as carrying blood to wounded soldiers overseas, a manufactured episode when he was too drunk to do his job, Godfrey remained stateside during World War II, doing his shows and carrying out his duties as a Naval Reserve officer around Washington.  He subsequently earned the rank of Commander, in part because of his vocal support for the Navy, particularly Naval aviation, on his programs. Godfrey's reputation for bullying members of his cast offstage was one exception.  That situation,  originally private, only became public with the October 19, 1953 on air firing of singer, and popular Godfrey show discovery, Julius LaRosa. After a minor backstage dispute with Godfrey, LaRosa violated an unwritten rule against Godfrey show regulars hiring personal management, despite the fact their contracts contained no such prohibition..  Given Godfrey's popularity, the incident became a national scandal at the time, made worse when Godfrey explained the firing by declaring LaRosa had "lost his humility," precipitating a public backlash against Godfrey himself. For a time, LaRosa saw his career flourish as daily negative press against his former employer grew, though his popularity eventually leveled off. Godfrey was also known to relish confrontations with CBS network executives, including network Chairman William S. Paley, criticizing them on the air, aware the high profits from commercial time on his three television and radio programs gave him the upper hand.  Unlike Fuller, Godfrey did not die suddenly. He survived 1959 lung cancer surgery despite losing part of a lung and remained on CBS radio until 1972. He died in 1983 at age 79 of emphysema.  At the time of the film's release, Godfrey was still highly controversial. Part of the controversy involved his subsequent firings of various "Little Godfreys."  1955 accusations of anti-Semitism that grew out of Godfrey's part-ownership of a Miami Beach hotel notorious for refusing to accommodate Jews also dogged him, though few believed the charges.  Godfrey insisted he had ended that policy when he became one of the owners.

Paragraph 6: Corey Harris' 45-yard kickoff return gave the Packers good field position, but they were unable to take advantage and had to punt after demoralizing third down play in which Favre overthrew wide open receiver Mark Clayton near the end zone. After forcing a punt, Robert Brooks' 21-yard return gave Green Bay the ball on their own 29-yard line with 2:24 left in regulation. Favre started off the drive with an 11-yard completion to Edgar Bennett. His next pass to tight end Ed West moved the ball 9 yards to midfield.  Following a 4-yard run by Bennett, Favre's 6-yard completion to Sharpe advanced the team to the Lions 40-yard line. On the next play, he took the snap and ran left. Kevin Scott, who was covering Sharpe one on one along the right sideline, slowed down a bit when he saw Favre running, just enough for Sharpe to pull ahead of him and Favre launched a 40-yard pass to Sharpe in the end zone for the game winning score.  Gray was tackled by Green Bay's Marcus Wilson after returning the ensuing kickoff just 8 yards to the 19-yard line, leaving Detroit with 51 seconds and all three timeouts left to drive for the winning touchdown.  Over the next four plays, Tony Bennett sacked Kramer for 2-yard loss, Sanders picked up 3 yards on a swing pass, and Kramer threw two incompletions.

Paragraph 17: Maraging steels (a portmanteau of "martensitic" and "aging") are steels that are known for possessing superior strength and toughness without losing ductility. Aging refers to the extended heat-treatment process. These steels are a special class of very-low-carbon ultra-high-strength steels that derive their strength not from carbon, but from precipitation of intermetallic compounds.

Paragraph 20: Corey Harris' 45-yard kickoff return gave the Packers good field position, but they were unable to take advantage and had to punt after demoralizing third down play in which Favre overthrew wide open receiver Mark Clayton near the end zone. After forcing a punt, Robert Brooks' 21-yard return gave Green Bay the ball on their own 29-yard line with 2:24 left in regulation. Favre started off the drive with an 11-yard completion to Edgar Bennett. His next pass to tight end Ed West moved the ball 9 yards to midfield.  Following a 4-yard run by Bennett, Favre's 6-yard completion to Sharpe advanced the team to the Lions 40-yard line. On the next play, he took the snap and ran left. Kevin Scott, who was covering Sharpe one on one along the right sideline, slowed down a bit when he saw Favre running, just enough for Sharpe to pull ahead of him and Favre launched a 40-yard pass to Sharpe in the end zone for the game winning score.  Gray was tackled by Green Bay's Marcus Wilson after returning the ensuing kickoff just 8 yards to the 19-yard line, leaving Detroit with 51 seconds and all three timeouts left to drive for the winning touchdown.  Over the next four plays, Tony Bennett sacked Kramer for 2-yard loss, Sanders picked up 3 yards on a swing pass, and Kramer threw two incompletions.

Paragraph 21: While the movie was based on the controversy surrounding Arthur Godfrey, whose tabloid real-life persona contrasted with his warm-hearted public demeanor, the fictional Fuller's failings differed greatly. Godfrey's controversies were mostly public, not private. His early years in broadcasting in Baltimore, Washington DC and New York City were largely noncontroversial, marked mainly by favorable public reaction to his informality on the air and his extemporized, irreverent commercials. The term "the Fuller Family" used in the film was based on the umbrella term "Little Godfreys" applied to his cast.  Godfrey's womanizing was long-rumored but never confirmed, and he was not a heavy drinker like Fuller. While Fuller was depicted as carrying blood to wounded soldiers overseas, a manufactured episode when he was too drunk to do his job, Godfrey remained stateside during World War II, doing his shows and carrying out his duties as a Naval Reserve officer around Washington.  He subsequently earned the rank of Commander, in part because of his vocal support for the Navy, particularly Naval aviation, on his programs. Godfrey's reputation for bullying members of his cast offstage was one exception.  That situation,  originally private, only became public with the October 19, 1953 on air firing of singer, and popular Godfrey show discovery, Julius LaRosa. After a minor backstage dispute with Godfrey, LaRosa violated an unwritten rule against Godfrey show regulars hiring personal management, despite the fact their contracts contained no such prohibition..  Given Godfrey's popularity, the incident became a national scandal at the time, made worse when Godfrey explained the firing by declaring LaRosa had "lost his humility," precipitating a public backlash against Godfrey himself. For a time, LaRosa saw his career flourish as daily negative press against his former employer grew, though his popularity eventually leveled off. Godfrey was also known to relish confrontations with CBS network executives, including network Chairman William S. Paley, criticizing them on the air, aware the high profits from commercial time on his three television and radio programs gave him the upper hand.  Unlike Fuller, Godfrey did not die suddenly. He survived 1959 lung cancer surgery despite losing part of a lung and remained on CBS radio until 1972. He died in 1983 at age 79 of emphysema.  At the time of the film's release, Godfrey was still highly controversial. Part of the controversy involved his subsequent firings of various "Little Godfreys."  1955 accusations of anti-Semitism that grew out of Godfrey's part-ownership of a Miami Beach hotel notorious for refusing to accommodate Jews also dogged him, though few believed the charges.  Godfrey insisted he had ended that policy when he became one of the owners.

Paragraph 24: Soon after 1680 Young managed to procure admission to deacon's orders at the hands of John Roan, Bishop of Killaloe, whom he circumvented by forging certificates of his learning and moral character. He obtained a curacy first at Tallogh in the county of Waterford, "whence for divers crimes he ran away on another man's horse, which he never restored". From his next curacy at Castlereagh, Co. Roscommon, he "was forced to flee for getting a bastard". While at Kildallon in the diocese of Kilmore he was delated to the bishop, Francis Marsh, afterwards Archbishop of Dublin, "for many extravagances, the least of which was marrying without banns or license". He now fled into the diocese of Raphoe, but was taken up for bigamy and imprisoned first at Lifford, then at Cavan. From gaol he wrote to both his wives, comparing himself to David, and assuring each of them that she alone was the object of his love. He succeeded in inducing his first wife not to appear against him, and seems to have been allowed benefit of clergy. Detained for non-payment of prison fees, he managed to procure his release by pretending to Ormonde (the "Popish Plot" being then in the air) that he could make disclosure of serious plots against the government. "The Scotchman", as Marsh calls him in a letter to Bishop Sprat, then ran away to England with his second wife. In England they operated at first under the name of Green, perambulating the country with forged testimonials, purporting to be in the hand of the archbishop of Canterbury. At Bury St. Edmunds, on 6 October 1684, they were pilloried as common cheats. From Bury gaol, on 30 September 1684, Young had written a long letter to Archbishop Sancroft, with an entirely novel account of his parentage and early life, expressing his mortal hatred of "discentors, especially that damnable faction of Presbytery", and stating that he had been put upon "the hellish and durty stratageme" of forging testimonials by one Wright, a non-existent "scrivener of Oxford". Failing in his object, he vowed to be revenged on the archbishop. As soon as he was released he forged a new set of testimonials with a dexterity which was generally admitted to be marvellous, and set to work, with a new alias and a new story, collecting large sums of money from wealthy clergymen, including three bishops who were intimate with Sancroft, and believed that they recognised his hand. At length in 1687 the imposture came under the notice of the archbishop, who caused to be inserted in the London Gazette (September and October 1687) advertisements warning the charitable to beware of Mrs. Jones and Robert Smith (i.e. Young and his paramour). Young next gave himself out as a grave Irish clergyman of good preferment, but a victim of Tyrconnel's persecuting fury; some funds were necessary to support this character, and these he seems to have obtained by a series of highly successful frauds at St. Albans, where he had secured the corrupt connivance of the postmaster. Forming a design of a wealthy marriage, Young was now anxious to get rid of Mary Hutt; but at this juncture the pair were betrayed to one of their victims, and lodged in Newgate on a charge of forgery. They escaped with the pillory and a fine, owing to lack of evidence; but, the fines remaining unpaid until 25 May 1692, they remained in prison for upwards of two years.

From gaol he wrote to both his wives, comparing himself to David, and assuring each of them that she alone was the object of his love. He succeeded in inducing his first wife not to appear against him, and seems to have been allowed benefit of clergy. Detained for non-payment of prison fees, he managed to procure his release by pretending to Ormonde (the "Popish Plot" being then in the air) that he could make disclosure of serious plots against the government. "The Scotchman", as Marsh calls him in a letter to Bishop Sprat, then ran away to England with his second wife. In England they operated at first under the name of Green, perambulating the country with forged testimonials, purporting to be in the hand of the archbishop of Canterbury. At Bury St. Edmunds, on 6 October 1684, they were pilloried as common cheats. From Bury gaol, on 30 September 1684, Young had written a long letter to Archbishop Sancroft, with an entirely novel account of his parentage and early life, expressing his mortal hatred of "discentors, especially that damnable faction of Presbytery", and stating that he had been put upon "the hellish and durty stratageme" of forging testimonials by one Wright, a non-existent "scrivener of Oxford". Failing in his object, he vowed to be revenged on the archbishop. As soon as he was released he forged a new set of testimonials with a dexterity which was generally admitted to be marvellous, and set to work, with a new alias and a new story, collecting large sums of money from wealthy clergymen, including three bishops who were intimate with Sancroft, and believed that they recognised his hand. At length in 1687 the imposture came under the notice of the archbishop, who caused to be inserted in the London Gazette (September and October 1687) advertisements warning the charitable to beware of Mrs. Jones and Robert Smith (i.e. Young and his paramour). Young next gave himself out as a grave Irish clergyman of good preferment, but a victim of Tyrconnel's persecuting fury; some funds were necessary to support this character, and these he seems to have obtained by a series of highly successful frauds at St. Albans, where he had secured the corrupt connivance of the postmaster. Forming a design of a wealthy marriage, Young was now anxious to get rid of Mary Hutt; but at this juncture the pair were betrayed to one of their victims, and lodged in Newgate on a charge of forgery. They escaped with the pillory and a fine, owing to lack of evidence; but, the fines remaining unpaid until 25 May 1692, they remained in prison for upwards of two years.

Paragraph 35: Greene beat Martin O'Donnell 5–3 to qualify for the first ranking event of the 2013–14 season, the Wuxi Classic. At the venue he saw off Michael Wasley 5–1, before losing 5–2 to David Morris in the second round. Greene reached his first final after 20 years as a professional at the minor-ranking Paul Hunter Classic in August. He won four matches to reach the quarter-finals where he beat Joe Swail 4–1, then held his nerve against Ali Carter to win 4–3 after leading 3–0. In the final he faced Ronnie O'Sullivan and was defeated 4–0 in 44 minutes. He secured the highest break in the qualifying rounds of the International Championships, a break of 142 in a 6–5 defeat to Thepchaiya Un-Nooh. At the Ruhr Open Greene made the highest break of his professional career, a 144 in a 4–0 first round win over Germany's Phil Barnes. Greene went on to beat Nigel Bond 4–2 and then lost 4–2 to Anthony Hamilton in the last 32. His season seemed to be heading for an anti-climax as he could not win more than one match in any event until he played in the PTC Finals. His aforementioned final saw him finish 17th on the Order of Merit to qualify and he then defeated Ricky Walden 4–1 and came from 3–0 down against Anthony Hamilton to triumph 4–3. The wins kept on coming for Greene as he knocked out number one seed Mark Allen 4–2 and Marco Fu 4–2 to play in his first ranking event final. After his semi-final match with Fu, Greene stated that the week had made him feel like a professional snooker player for the first time in two years as he had been playing well against the top players. He played practice partner Barry Hawkins in the final and did not pot a ball in the first two frames and went on to be beaten 4–0, but the £38,000 runner-up's cheque is the biggest of his career to date. It also helped him climb 12 spots in the rankings to end the season as the world number 44.
