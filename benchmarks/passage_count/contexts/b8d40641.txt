Paragraph 1: In October 2017, Sami returns again to Salem amidst rumours that Will is somehow still alive. She visits Will's grave, and Lucas finds her there, and they talk about Will and what is happening. Sami tells Lucas that Stefano DiMera's old associate, Dr Wilhelm Rolf, who has brought people back in the past, is the source of the claim that Will is alive. Sami is determined to find him, and to help Lucas, who in his grief has started drinking again. With the help of EJ's brothers, Rolf is tricked into coming to Salem, where Sami accosts him and tries to extract information. Rolf reveals he was the masked medical examiner that attended Will's body just after Sami and Lucas viewed it. He says Stefano "had nothing to do with Will's resurrection", but then kills himself before revealing his true employer. The Salem Police Department hack Rolf's computer and find the source of payments to Rolf's account is an address in Memphis. Sami persuades the police to give her the address, and flies off to Memphis with John, Marlena, Sonny and his current partner, Paul. Sami does not include or tell Lucas, as he is drinking and having hallucinations. Sami gets herself arrested when they break into the property, and Lucas, who has followed them to Memphis, goes to see her at the police station. Whilst concerned about her, he is furious with her for leaving him behind, and they argue. Sami implores him to seek help for his drinking and to help her, but he, not wanting to let himself believe Will is alive, walks out. Lucas goes to a bar to drink, where he actually sees Will (now Chandler Massey) but thinks he is hallucinating again. Will's father-in-law, the lawyer Justin Kiriakis, arranges for Sami's release – and she pursues leads on Will. However, they come to a dead end, and Sami and Lucas comfort each other before returning to Salem. Back in Salem, Sami is still discontent, and persuades Rafe to dig up Will's grave – and it is found to be empty. Sami flies back to Memphis and finds Will alive – but he has no memory of her or any of his family, or of his life before he was strangled. Will returns to Salem to find out about his former life, where Lucas and Will are re-united. Will meets his daughter, but even this does not trigger Will's memory. Sami is desperate to help Will remember and learning that re-living a traumatic event can trigger memory, she has Will strangled again in a re-staging of the original attack. Absolutely terrified, Will rejects his mom and gives up trying to remember; Lucas is furious at her for her actions. Then Sami's brother Eric helps mends fences between Will and Sami, and things calm down a bit. Lucas is still upset that Will cannot remember him and may never, so carries on drinking and ends up crashing his car whilst under influence. Both concerned and angry, Sami visits Lucas in hospital and, pulling out all the stops, helps Lucas draws strength from their shared love, encouraging him to take the first step towards sobriety, upon which he agrees to go to rehab. Sami and Will reconcile, but she realises her presence in Salem are not helping him, so she bids Will a loving good-bye and returns to her other children who are in Switzerland. Lucas returns from rehab, now sober, and despite Will's amnesia, begins building a new relationship with him.

Paragraph 2: John Haliburton, second son of Sir Adam Haliburton, married the daughter and co-heiress of William de Vaux, Lord of Dirleton. One of the first things he did was to order the reconstruction of the castle of Dirleton. John was later killed at the battle of Nisbet in 1355, a battle between the English forces from Morham Castle on the Tweed and local landowners including Halyburton. Haliburton’s son John inherited Dirleton and from around 1382 is known as Sir John Haliburton of Dirleton. Sir John married Margaret, daughter of Sir John Cameron of Ballegarno and the couple had three children, the eldest, Walter, being the heir to the lands and title. Walter Haliburton of Dirleton appears in various charters dating from the reign of Robert III. This Walter married Isobel, daughter of the Duke of Albany. Their son, Sir Walter Haliburton of Dirleton, was a hostage in England on behalf of King James I. In 1403 he married Mary, daughter of Archibald the third Earl of Douglas, and widow of David, Duke of Rothesay the eldest son of King Robert III. In 1438 he was appointed Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, and in 1441 was created Lord Dirleton or Halyburton of Dirleton. The couple had several children of whom John, the eldest, succeeded by 1447. This John, Lord Haliburton, was appointed Sheriff of Berwick. He married Janet, sister of Lord Seton, and they had two sons Patrick and George. Patrick duly became the second Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. He was granted a charter of the Barony of Dirleton in 1451, and another of the dominical lands of the said barony and castle in 1452. On his death in 1459 the land and titles went to his brother George. George, the third Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had a wife named Mariota and three sons. The eldest Archibald had a charter of Dirleton but he is thought to have been killed, along with his father, at the battle of Sauchie on 11 June 1488. He and his wife were the parents of James who then became the fourth Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. Lord James died unmarried in 1503 and was succeeded by his uncle Patrick. Patrick, fifth Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had three daughters by his first wife Margaret Douglas, and on his death the title and lands passed to their daughter Janet. Janet, Baroness Haliburton of Dirleton, married William second Lord Ruthven, and when she died around 1560 the titles fell to her son Patrick, the third Lord Ruthven. Patrick was implicated in the murder of David Rizzio, the favourite of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1566. Patrick’s son William, Lord Ruthven and Dirleton, was created Earl of Gowrie in 1581 but was attainted and subsequently executed in 1582, and all honours forfeited. In 1586 his son James was restored to all honours, including the Barony of Dirleton, but when he was found guilty of treason through his part in the Gowrie Conspiracy the honours were again forfeited. The Ruthven Raid or Conspiracy was an attempt by a group of disaffected noblemen led by William Ruthven to replace the government of Arran-Lennox with one more favourable to the Reformers, and to kidnap the king.

In 1438 he was appointed Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, and in 1441 was created Lord Dirleton or Halyburton of Dirleton. The couple had several children of whom John, the eldest, succeeded by 1447. This John, Lord Haliburton, was appointed Sheriff of Berwick. He married Janet, sister of Lord Seton, and they had two sons Patrick and George. Patrick duly became the second Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. He was granted a charter of the Barony of Dirleton in 1451, and another of the dominical lands of the said barony and castle in 1452. On his death in 1459 the land and titles went to his brother George. George, the third Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had a wife named Mariota and three sons. The eldest Archibald had a charter of Dirleton but he is thought to have been killed, along with his father, at the battle of Sauchie on 11 June 1488. He and his wife were the parents of James who then became the fourth Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. Lord James died unmarried in 1503 and was succeeded by his uncle Patrick. Patrick, fifth Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had three daughters by his first wife Margaret Douglas, and on his death the title and lands passed to their daughter Janet. Janet, Baroness Haliburton of Dirleton, married William second Lord Ruthven, and when she died around 1560 the titles fell to her son Patrick, the third Lord Ruthven. Patrick was implicated in the murder of David Rizzio, the favourite of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1566. Patrick’s son William, Lord Ruthven and Dirleton, was created Earl of Gowrie in 1581 but was attainted and subsequently executed in 1582, and all honours forfeited. In 1586 his son James was restored to all honours, including the Barony of Dirleton, but when he was found guilty of treason through his part in the Gowrie Conspiracy the honours were again forfeited. The Ruthven Raid or Conspiracy was an attempt by a group of disaffected noblemen led by William Ruthven to replace the government of Arran-Lennox with one more favourable to the Reformers, and to kidnap the king.

Paragraph 12: John Haliburton, second son of Sir Adam Haliburton, married the daughter and co-heiress of William de Vaux, Lord of Dirleton. One of the first things he did was to order the reconstruction of the castle of Dirleton. John was later killed at the battle of Nisbet in 1355, a battle between the English forces from Morham Castle on the Tweed and local landowners including Halyburton. Haliburton’s son John inherited Dirleton and from around 1382 is known as Sir John Haliburton of Dirleton. Sir John married Margaret, daughter of Sir John Cameron of Ballegarno and the couple had three children, the eldest, Walter, being the heir to the lands and title.

Paragraph 13: In October 2017, Sami returns again to Salem amidst rumours that Will is somehow still alive. She visits Will's grave, and Lucas finds her there, and they talk about Will and what is happening. Sami tells Lucas that Stefano DiMera's old associate, Dr Wilhelm Rolf, who has brought people back in the past, is the source of the claim that Will is alive. Sami is determined to find him, and to help Lucas, who in his grief has started drinking again. With the help of EJ's brothers, Rolf is tricked into coming to Salem, where Sami accosts him and tries to extract information. Rolf reveals he was the masked medical examiner that attended Will's body just after Sami and Lucas viewed it. He says Stefano "had nothing to do with Will's resurrection", but then kills himself before revealing his true employer. The Salem Police Department hack Rolf's computer and find the source of payments to Rolf's account is an address in Memphis. Sami persuades the police to give her the address, and flies off to Memphis with John, Marlena, Sonny and his current partner, Paul. Sami does not include or tell Lucas, as he is drinking and having hallucinations. Sami gets herself arrested when they break into the property, and Lucas, who has followed them to Memphis, goes to see her at the police station. Whilst concerned about her, he is furious with her for leaving him behind, and they argue. Sami implores him to seek help for his drinking and to help her, but he, not wanting to let himself believe Will is alive, walks out. Lucas goes to a bar to drink, where he actually sees Will (now Chandler Massey) but thinks he is hallucinating again. Will's father-in-law, the lawyer Justin Kiriakis, arranges for Sami's release – and she pursues leads on Will. However, they come to a dead end, and Sami and Lucas comfort each other before returning to Salem. Back in Salem, Sami is still discontent, and persuades Rafe to dig up Will's grave – and it is found to be empty. Sami flies back to Memphis and finds Will alive – but he has no memory of her or any of his family, or of his life before he was strangled. Will returns to Salem to find out about his former life, where Lucas and Will are re-united. Will meets his daughter, but even this does not trigger Will's memory. Sami is desperate to help Will remember and learning that re-living a traumatic event can trigger memory, she has Will strangled again in a re-staging of the original attack. Absolutely terrified, Will rejects his mom and gives up trying to remember; Lucas is furious at her for her actions. Then Sami's brother Eric helps mends fences between Will and Sami, and things calm down a bit. Lucas is still upset that Will cannot remember him and may never, so carries on drinking and ends up crashing his car whilst under influence. Both concerned and angry, Sami visits Lucas in hospital and, pulling out all the stops, helps Lucas draws strength from their shared love, encouraging him to take the first step towards sobriety, upon which he agrees to go to rehab. Sami and Will reconcile, but she realises her presence in Salem are not helping him, so she bids Will a loving good-bye and returns to her other children who are in Switzerland. Lucas returns from rehab, now sober, and despite Will's amnesia, begins building a new relationship with him.

Sami is desperate to help Will remember and learning that re-living a traumatic event can trigger memory, she has Will strangled again in a re-staging of the original attack. Absolutely terrified, Will rejects his mom and gives up trying to remember; Lucas is furious at her for her actions. Then Sami's brother Eric helps mends fences between Will and Sami, and things calm down a bit. Lucas is still upset that Will cannot remember him and may never, so carries on drinking and ends up crashing his car whilst under influence. Both concerned and angry, Sami visits Lucas in hospital and, pulling out all the stops, helps Lucas draws strength from their shared love, encouraging him to take the first step towards sobriety, upon which he agrees to go to rehab. Sami and Will reconcile, but she realises her presence in Salem are not helping him, so she bids Will a loving good-bye and returns to her other children who are in Switzerland. Lucas returns from rehab, now sober, and despite Will's amnesia, begins building a new relationship with him.

Paragraph 22: In October 2017, Sami returns again to Salem amidst rumours that Will is somehow still alive. She visits Will's grave, and Lucas finds her there, and they talk about Will and what is happening. Sami tells Lucas that Stefano DiMera's old associate, Dr Wilhelm Rolf, who has brought people back in the past, is the source of the claim that Will is alive. Sami is determined to find him, and to help Lucas, who in his grief has started drinking again. With the help of EJ's brothers, Rolf is tricked into coming to Salem, where Sami accosts him and tries to extract information. Rolf reveals he was the masked medical examiner that attended Will's body just after Sami and Lucas viewed it. He says Stefano "had nothing to do with Will's resurrection", but then kills himself before revealing his true employer. The Salem Police Department hack Rolf's computer and find the source of payments to Rolf's account is an address in Memphis. Sami persuades the police to give her the address, and flies off to Memphis with John, Marlena, Sonny and his current partner, Paul. Sami does not include or tell Lucas, as he is drinking and having hallucinations. Sami gets herself arrested when they break into the property, and Lucas, who has followed them to Memphis, goes to see her at the police station. Whilst concerned about her, he is furious with her for leaving him behind, and they argue. Sami implores him to seek help for his drinking and to help her, but he, not wanting to let himself believe Will is alive, walks out. Lucas goes to a bar to drink, where he actually sees Will (now Chandler Massey) but thinks he is hallucinating again. Will's father-in-law, the lawyer Justin Kiriakis, arranges for Sami's release – and she pursues leads on Will. However, they come to a dead end, and Sami and Lucas comfort each other before returning to Salem. Back in Salem, Sami is still discontent, and persuades Rafe to dig up Will's grave – and it is found to be empty. Sami flies back to Memphis and finds Will alive – but he has no memory of her or any of his family, or of his life before he was strangled.

Paragraph 23: John Haliburton, second son of Sir Adam Haliburton, married the daughter and co-heiress of William de Vaux, Lord of Dirleton. One of the first things he did was to order the reconstruction of the castle of Dirleton. John was later killed at the battle of Nisbet in 1355, a battle between the English forces from Morham Castle on the Tweed and local landowners including Halyburton. Haliburton’s son John inherited Dirleton and from around 1382 is known as Sir John Haliburton of Dirleton. Sir John married Margaret, daughter of Sir John Cameron of Ballegarno and the couple had three children, the eldest, Walter, being the heir to the lands and title. Walter Haliburton of Dirleton appears in various charters dating from the reign of Robert III. This Walter married Isobel, daughter of the Duke of Albany. Their son, Sir Walter Haliburton of Dirleton, was a hostage in England on behalf of King James I. In 1403 he married Mary, daughter of Archibald the third Earl of Douglas, and widow of David, Duke of Rothesay the eldest son of King Robert III. In 1438 he was appointed Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, and in 1441 was created Lord Dirleton or Halyburton of Dirleton. The couple had several children of whom John, the eldest, succeeded by 1447. This John, Lord Haliburton, was appointed Sheriff of Berwick. He married Janet, sister of Lord Seton, and they had two sons Patrick and George. Patrick duly became the second Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. He was granted a charter of the Barony of Dirleton in 1451, and another of the dominical lands of the said barony and castle in 1452. On his death in 1459 the land and titles went to his brother George. George, the third Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had a wife named Mariota and three sons. The eldest Archibald had a charter of Dirleton but he is thought to have been killed, along with his father, at the battle of Sauchie on 11 June 1488. He and his wife were the parents of James who then became the fourth Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. Lord James died unmarried in 1503 and was succeeded by his uncle Patrick. Patrick, fifth Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had three daughters by his first wife Margaret Douglas, and on his death the title and lands passed to their daughter Janet. Janet, Baroness Haliburton of Dirleton, married William second Lord Ruthven, and when she died around 1560 the titles fell to her son Patrick, the third Lord Ruthven. Patrick was implicated in the murder of David Rizzio, the favourite of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1566. Patrick’s son William, Lord Ruthven and Dirleton, was created Earl of Gowrie in 1581 but was attainted and subsequently executed in 1582, and all honours forfeited. In 1586 his son James was restored to all honours, including the Barony of Dirleton, but when he was found guilty of treason through his part in the Gowrie Conspiracy the honours were again forfeited. The Ruthven Raid or Conspiracy was an attempt by a group of disaffected noblemen led by William Ruthven to replace the government of Arran-Lennox with one more favourable to the Reformers, and to kidnap the king.

She visits Will's grave, and Lucas finds her there, and they talk about Will and what is happening. Sami tells Lucas that Stefano DiMera's old associate, Dr Wilhelm Rolf, who has brought people back in the past, is the source of the claim that Will is alive. Sami is determined to find him, and to help Lucas, who in his grief has started drinking again. With the help of EJ's brothers, Rolf is tricked into coming to Salem, where Sami accosts him and tries to extract information. Rolf reveals he was the masked medical examiner that attended Will's body just after Sami and Lucas viewed it. He says Stefano "had nothing to do with Will's resurrection", but then kills himself before revealing his true employer. The Salem Police Department hack Rolf's computer and find the source of payments to Rolf's account is an address in Memphis. Sami persuades the police to give her the address, and flies off to Memphis with John, Marlena, Sonny and his current partner, Paul. Sami does not include or tell Lucas, as he is drinking and having hallucinations. Sami gets herself arrested when they break into the property, and Lucas, who has followed them to Memphis, goes to see her at the police station. Whilst concerned about her, he is furious with her for leaving him behind, and they argue. Sami implores him to seek help for his drinking and to help her, but he, not wanting to let himself believe Will is alive, walks out. Lucas goes to a bar to drink, where he actually sees Will (now Chandler Massey) but thinks he is hallucinating again. Will's father-in-law, the lawyer Justin Kiriakis, arranges for Sami's release – and she pursues leads on Will. However, they come to a dead end, and Sami and Lucas comfort each other before returning to Salem. Back in Salem, Sami is still discontent, and persuades Rafe to dig up Will's grave – and it is found to be empty. Sami flies back to Memphis and finds Will alive – but he has no memory of her or any of his family, or of his life before he was strangled. Will returns to Salem to find out about his former life, where Lucas and Will are re-united. Will meets his daughter, but even this does not trigger Will's memory. Sami is desperate to help Will remember and learning that re-living a traumatic event can trigger memory, she has Will strangled again in a re-staging of the original attack. Absolutely terrified, Will rejects his mom and gives up trying to remember; Lucas is furious at her for her actions. Then Sami's brother Eric helps mends fences between Will and Sami, and things calm down a bit. Lucas is still upset that Will cannot remember him and may never, so carries on drinking and ends up crashing his car whilst under influence. Both concerned and angry, Sami visits Lucas in hospital and, pulling out all the stops, helps Lucas draws strength from their shared love, encouraging him to take the first step towards sobriety, upon which he agrees to go to rehab. Sami and Will reconcile, but she realises her presence in Salem are not helping him, so she bids Will a loving good-bye and returns to her other children who are in Switzerland. Lucas returns from rehab, now sober, and despite Will's amnesia, begins building a new relationship with him.

Paragraph 34: John Haliburton, second son of Sir Adam Haliburton, married the daughter and co-heiress of William de Vaux, Lord of Dirleton. One of the first things he did was to order the reconstruction of the castle of Dirleton. John was later killed at the battle of Nisbet in 1355, a battle between the English forces from Morham Castle on the Tweed and local landowners including Halyburton. Haliburton’s son John inherited Dirleton and from around 1382 is known as Sir John Haliburton of Dirleton. Sir John married Margaret, daughter of Sir John Cameron of Ballegarno and the couple had three children, the eldest, Walter, being the heir to the lands and title. Walter Haliburton of Dirleton appears in various charters dating from the reign of Robert III. This Walter married Isobel, daughter of the Duke of Albany. Their son, Sir Walter Haliburton of Dirleton, was a hostage in England on behalf of King James I. In 1403 he married Mary, daughter of Archibald the third Earl of Douglas, and widow of David, Duke of Rothesay the eldest son of King Robert III. In 1438 he was appointed Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, and in 1441 was created Lord Dirleton or Halyburton of Dirleton. The couple had several children of whom John, the eldest, succeeded by 1447. This John, Lord Haliburton, was appointed Sheriff of Berwick. He married Janet, sister of Lord Seton, and they had two sons Patrick and George. Patrick duly became the second Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. He was granted a charter of the Barony of Dirleton in 1451, and another of the dominical lands of the said barony and castle in 1452. On his death in 1459 the land and titles went to his brother George. George, the third Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had a wife named Mariota and three sons. The eldest Archibald had a charter of Dirleton but he is thought to have been killed, along with his father, at the battle of Sauchie on 11 June 1488. He and his wife were the parents of James who then became the fourth Lord Haliburton of Dirleton. Lord James died unmarried in 1503 and was succeeded by his uncle Patrick. Patrick, fifth Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, had three daughters by his first wife Margaret Douglas, and on his death the title and lands passed to their daughter Janet. Janet, Baroness Haliburton of Dirleton, married William second Lord Ruthven, and when she died around 1560 the titles fell to her son Patrick, the third Lord Ruthven. Patrick was implicated in the murder of David Rizzio, the favourite of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1566. Patrick’s son William, Lord Ruthven and Dirleton, was created Earl of Gowrie in 1581 but was attainted and subsequently executed in 1582, and all honours forfeited. In 1586 his son James was restored to all honours, including the Barony of Dirleton, but when he was found guilty of treason through his part in the Gowrie Conspiracy the honours were again forfeited. The Ruthven Raid or Conspiracy was an attempt by a group of disaffected noblemen led by William Ruthven to replace the government of Arran-Lennox with one more favourable to the Reformers, and to kidnap the king.
