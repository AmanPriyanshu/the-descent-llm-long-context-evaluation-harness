Paragraph 1: An object's or space's temperature increases when heat energy moves into it, increasing the average kinetic energy of its atoms, e.g., of things and air in a room.  Heat energy leaving an object or space lowers its temperature.  Heat flows from one place to another (always from a higher temperature to a lower one) by up to three processes: conduction, convection and radiation. In conduction, energy is passed from one atom to another by direct contact. In convection, heat energy moves by conduction into some movable fluid (such as air or water) and the fluid moves from one place to another, carrying the heat with it.  At some point the heat energy in the fluid is usually transferred to some other object by means conduction again.  The movement of the fluid can be driven by negative-buoyancy, as when cooler (and therefore denser) air drops and thus upwardly displaces warmer (less-dense) air (natural convection), or by fans or pumps (forced convection).  In radiation, the heated atoms make electromagnetic emissions absorbed by remote other atoms, whether nearby or at astronomical distance. For example, the sun radiates heat as both invisible and visible electromagnetic energy. What we know as "light" is but a narrow region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Paragraph 2: A man called Nana Takyi Fri went out hunting daily to feed himself and his younger sisters after they had settled in a forest. His youngest sister, Afia Ankomah decided to go fishing in the forest, preferring fish to the meat of an animal. When she got to the water banks, she put her fishing basket into the water to catch fish, but when she though that she had caught a fish, she saw that something else had ended up in the basket. Not thinking much of it, she took it out of the basket. But all of a sudden, the place became dark. Every time she put it back into the basket the darkness would go, and every time she took it out of the basket, the darkness would return. As a result, she knew that she'd have to take it home as if she didn't, the place would become dark and she wouldn't be able to retrace her steps home. So she took it home, but asa soon as she reached home, she was possessed by the object. The object, through Afia identified himself to her siblings as the river deity Asuo Tano, for which he was to live with them. He brought Nana Takyi Fri and his family to the place where he dwelled, protected by a horde of baboons. He taught Nana Takyi Fri and his family his laws and rules so they could live with him and his family. Nana Takyi Fri became the hunter for the family, whilst Afia Ankomah (the youngest sister) became the first Priestess for Ta Kora. In time she married Amadu, a Dagomban blacksmith, whose first wife was called Amea Tomfour who came from Sheawu Besease. Nana Takyi Fri pleaded with Amadu to marry his little Priestess sister for the reason to relieve her of her spiritual workload through her nephews and nieces, as Takyi was not interested in helping his sister with her spiritual work. Amadu agreed and he and Afi got married and have a son, whom they called Nana Fosu Aduanwoma. When he came of age, his mother Afia retired all of her spiritual duties to him and he inherited the shrine elements of the Great Tano. After this, Takyi decided to move forward for his plan to find a new settlement. He moved to Tuabodom with Amoafowaa (his sister), leaving his little sister behind. The Great Tano decided to send one of his children called Twumpuro to possess Takyi Ofri. Takyi Fri and Amoafowaa left Takyi Ofri behind after their Priestess sister to help her and her son with their spiritual duties. It was clear that Takyi Fri was trying to avoid his spiritual assignments, something that the Great Tano would not allow. So when Takyi Fri moved to a new settlement in present-day Tachiman, the Great Tano again sent his son Taamensah (Tano Mensah) to possess Takyi Fri's sister Amoafowaa. Takyi Fri finally realised that he couldn't keep running from his spiritual obligations, so he accepted his spiritual obligations and stayed at his settlement, in the process founding the Techiman nation, which means the nation of Takyi.

As a result, she knew that she'd have to take it home as if she didn't, the place would become dark and she wouldn't be able to retrace her steps home. So she took it home, but asa soon as she reached home, she was possessed by the object. The object, through Afia identified himself to her siblings as the river deity Asuo Tano, for which he was to live with them. He brought Nana Takyi Fri and his family to the place where he dwelled, protected by a horde of baboons. He taught Nana Takyi Fri and his family his laws and rules so they could live with him and his family. Nana Takyi Fri became the hunter for the family, whilst Afia Ankomah (the youngest sister) became the first Priestess for Ta Kora. In time she married Amadu, a Dagomban blacksmith, whose first wife was called Amea Tomfour who came from Sheawu Besease. Nana Takyi Fri pleaded with Amadu to marry his little Priestess sister for the reason to relieve her of her spiritual workload through her nephews and nieces, as Takyi was not interested in helping his sister with her spiritual work. Amadu agreed and he and Afi got married and have a son, whom they called Nana Fosu Aduanwoma. When he came of age, his mother Afia retired all of her spiritual duties to him and he inherited the shrine elements of the Great Tano. After this, Takyi decided to move forward for his plan to find a new settlement. He moved to Tuabodom with Amoafowaa (his sister), leaving his little sister behind. The Great Tano decided to send one of his children called Twumpuro to possess Takyi Ofri. Takyi Fri and Amoafowaa left Takyi Ofri behind after their Priestess sister to help her and her son with their spiritual duties. It was clear that Takyi Fri was trying to avoid his spiritual assignments, something that the Great Tano would not allow. So when Takyi Fri moved to a new settlement in present-day Tachiman, the Great Tano again sent his son Taamensah (Tano Mensah) to possess Takyi Fri's sister Amoafowaa. Takyi Fri finally realised that he couldn't keep running from his spiritual obligations, so he accepted his spiritual obligations and stayed at his settlement, in the process founding the Techiman nation, which means the nation of Takyi.

Paragraph 16: An object's or space's temperature increases when heat energy moves into it, increasing the average kinetic energy of its atoms, e.g., of things and air in a room.  Heat energy leaving an object or space lowers its temperature.  Heat flows from one place to another (always from a higher temperature to a lower one) by up to three processes: conduction, convection and radiation. In conduction, energy is passed from one atom to another by direct contact. In convection, heat energy moves by conduction into some movable fluid (such as air or water) and the fluid moves from one place to another, carrying the heat with it.  At some point the heat energy in the fluid is usually transferred to some other object by means conduction again.  The movement of the fluid can be driven by negative-buoyancy, as when cooler (and therefore denser) air drops and thus upwardly displaces warmer (less-dense) air (natural convection), or by fans or pumps (forced convection).  In radiation, the heated atoms make electromagnetic emissions absorbed by remote other atoms, whether nearby or at astronomical distance. For example, the sun radiates heat as both invisible and visible electromagnetic energy. What we know as "light" is but a narrow region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Paragraph 17: A man called Nana Takyi Fri went out hunting daily to feed himself and his younger sisters after they had settled in a forest. His youngest sister, Afia Ankomah decided to go fishing in the forest, preferring fish to the meat of an animal. When she got to the water banks, she put her fishing basket into the water to catch fish, but when she though that she had caught a fish, she saw that something else had ended up in the basket. Not thinking much of it, she took it out of the basket. But all of a sudden, the place became dark.

Takyi Fri and Amoafowaa left Takyi Ofri behind after their Priestess sister to help her and her son with their spiritual duties. It was clear that Takyi Fri was trying to avoid his spiritual assignments, something that the Great Tano would not allow. So when Takyi Fri moved to a new settlement in present-day Tachiman, the Great Tano again sent his son Taamensah (Tano Mensah) to possess Takyi Fri's sister Amoafowaa. Takyi Fri finally realised that he couldn't keep running from his spiritual obligations, so he accepted his spiritual obligations and stayed at his settlement, in the process founding the Techiman nation, which means the nation of Takyi.

Paragraph 35: A man called Nana Takyi Fri went out hunting daily to feed himself and his younger sisters after they had settled in a forest. His youngest sister, Afia Ankomah decided to go fishing in the forest, preferring fish to the meat of an animal. When she got to the water banks, she put her fishing basket into the water to catch fish, but when she though that she had caught a fish, she saw that something else had ended up in the basket. Not thinking much of it, she took it out of the basket. But all of a sudden, the place became dark. Every time she put it back into the basket the darkness would go, and every time she took it out of the basket, the darkness would return. As a result, she knew that she'd have to take it home as if she didn't, the place would become dark and she wouldn't be able to retrace her steps home. So she took it home, but asa soon as she reached home, she was possessed by the object. The object, through Afia identified himself to her siblings as the river deity Asuo Tano, for which he was to live with them. He brought Nana Takyi Fri and his family to the place where he dwelled, protected by a horde of baboons. He taught Nana Takyi Fri and his family his laws and rules so they could live with him and his family. Nana Takyi Fri became the hunter for the family, whilst Afia Ankomah (the youngest sister) became the first Priestess for Ta Kora. In time she married Amadu, a Dagomban blacksmith, whose first wife was called Amea Tomfour who came from Sheawu Besease. Nana Takyi Fri pleaded with Amadu to marry his little Priestess sister for the reason to relieve her of her spiritual workload through her nephews and nieces, as Takyi was not interested in helping his sister with her spiritual work. Amadu agreed and he and Afi got married and have a son, whom they called Nana Fosu Aduanwoma. When he came of age, his mother Afia retired all of her spiritual duties to him and he inherited the shrine elements of the Great Tano. After this, Takyi decided to move forward for his plan to find a new settlement. He moved to Tuabodom with Amoafowaa (his sister), leaving his little sister behind. The Great Tano decided to send one of his children called Twumpuro to possess Takyi Ofri. Takyi Fri and Amoafowaa left Takyi Ofri behind after their Priestess sister to help her and her son with their spiritual duties.

Takyi Fri finally realised that he couldn't keep running from his spiritual obligations, so he accepted his spiritual obligations and stayed at his settlement, in the process founding the Techiman nation, which means the nation of Takyi.

Paragraph 36: He succeeded in raising his grades enough in his sophomore year to allow him to play sports his junior year, when he had grown significantly (to six feet tall). He starred on the varsity football team, playing quarterback on offense and safety on defense for coach Andy Puplis. He played varsity basketball and was a pitcher and left fielder for the varsity baseball team. His baseball skills brought him an offer from the professional St. Louis Browns with a $3,000 signing bonus. Nitschke was also offered scholarships from college football programs around the country. Puplis advised him to accept a football scholarship. Wanting to play at a Big Ten university, with a chance to appear in the Rose Bowl, he accepted a football scholarship to the University of Illinois in 1954.

Paragraph 38: An object's or space's temperature increases when heat energy moves into it, increasing the average kinetic energy of its atoms, e.g., of things and air in a room.  Heat energy leaving an object or space lowers its temperature.  Heat flows from one place to another (always from a higher temperature to a lower one) by up to three processes: conduction, convection and radiation. In conduction, energy is passed from one atom to another by direct contact. In convection, heat energy moves by conduction into some movable fluid (such as air or water) and the fluid moves from one place to another, carrying the heat with it.  At some point the heat energy in the fluid is usually transferred to some other object by means conduction again.  The movement of the fluid can be driven by negative-buoyancy, as when cooler (and therefore denser) air drops and thus upwardly displaces warmer (less-dense) air (natural convection), or by fans or pumps (forced convection).  In radiation, the heated atoms make electromagnetic emissions absorbed by remote other atoms, whether nearby or at astronomical distance. For example, the sun radiates heat as both invisible and visible electromagnetic energy. What we know as "light" is but a narrow region of the electromagnetic spectrum.
