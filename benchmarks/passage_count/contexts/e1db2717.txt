Paragraph 3: After a struggle to put away a lowly FCS team, few gave the Bearcats any chance of victory as they made their first ever trip to Ann Arbor to face the University of Michigan. Over 111,000 the largest crowd ever to see a Cincinnati team piled into Michigan Stadium for the contest. The 8th ranked Wolverines took the opening kickoff and effortlessly went 80 yards in 7 plays, the capper a 43 touchdown pass from Wilton Speight to Keoka Crawford. The Bearcats did themselves no favors as Tyree Kinnel picked off an errant Hayden Moore pass and cruised 28 yards to the end zone. Just like that it was 14–0 mid first quarter and a national TV audience braced for a rout. But the Bearcats hung tough and cut the Wolverine lead in half when Mike Boone crashed in from a yard out. The Bearcats didn’t allow another touchdown in the first half, but Michigan increased its lead to 17–7 at the half on a short field goal early in the 2nd quarter. The Bearcats were able to force turnovers but were unable to put points up from them. Further hampering the Bearcats they failed to cash in on their last possession of the half as a 51 yard field goal at the halftime gun was short. Taking the second half kickoff, the Bearcats put together its most impressive drive of the afternoon. A 10 play 85 yard drive was capped by a 10 yard connection from Hayden Moore to Khalil Lewis and the Bearcats were within 3 at 17–14. A majority of the 111,383 at the Big House were growing increasingly annoyed that the double digit underdog Bearcats were still in the game. The Wolverines pushed the lead back to 10 late in the quarter with another touchdown pass from Speight to Grant Perry. The 4th quarter was simply put, a disaster. The Wolverines increased their lead to 27–14 on a short field goal then when the Bearcats were set to punt on their next possession, the snap sailed over punter James Smith’s head towards the end zone. Smith batted the ball out of the end zone for a safety. Moore was picked off a second time late in the quarter and the result was another pick six. The Michigan defense outscored the Bearcats 16–14 en route to a 36–14 final. Though the Bearcats were dominated yardage wise, they stayed in the game much longer than expected. The Bearcats only managed 211 yards offense on the day and fell to 1–1.

The Wolverines increased their lead to 27–14 on a short field goal then when the Bearcats were set to punt on their next possession, the snap sailed over punter James Smith’s head towards the end zone. Smith batted the ball out of the end zone for a safety. Moore was picked off a second time late in the quarter and the result was another pick six. The Michigan defense outscored the Bearcats 16–14 en route to a 36–14 final. Though the Bearcats were dominated yardage wise, they stayed in the game much longer than expected. The Bearcats only managed 211 yards offense on the day and fell to 1–1.

Paragraph 34: After a struggle to put away a lowly FCS team, few gave the Bearcats any chance of victory as they made their first ever trip to Ann Arbor to face the University of Michigan. Over 111,000 the largest crowd ever to see a Cincinnati team piled into Michigan Stadium for the contest. The 8th ranked Wolverines took the opening kickoff and effortlessly went 80 yards in 7 plays, the capper a 43 touchdown pass from Wilton Speight to Keoka Crawford. The Bearcats did themselves no favors as Tyree Kinnel picked off an errant Hayden Moore pass and cruised 28 yards to the end zone. Just like that it was 14–0 mid first quarter and a national TV audience braced for a rout. But the Bearcats hung tough and cut the Wolverine lead in half when Mike Boone crashed in from a yard out. The Bearcats didn’t allow another touchdown in the first half, but Michigan increased its lead to 17–7 at the half on a short field goal early in the 2nd quarter. The Bearcats were able to force turnovers but were unable to put points up from them. Further hampering the Bearcats they failed to cash in on their last possession of the half as a 51 yard field goal at the halftime gun was short. Taking the second half kickoff, the Bearcats put together its most impressive drive of the afternoon. A 10 play 85 yard drive was capped by a 10 yard connection from Hayden Moore to Khalil Lewis and the Bearcats were within 3 at 17–14. A majority of the 111,383 at the Big House were growing increasingly annoyed that the double digit underdog Bearcats were still in the game. The Wolverines pushed the lead back to 10 late in the quarter with another touchdown pass from Speight to Grant Perry. The 4th quarter was simply put, a disaster.
