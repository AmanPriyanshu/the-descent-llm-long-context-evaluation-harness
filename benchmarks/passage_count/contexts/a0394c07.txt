Paragraph 1: Schwarz began his professional career as a forward for Ferencvárosi TC when he was seventeen.  In 1922, Ferencvárosi won the Hungarian Cup.  That fall, Schwarz moved to Czechoslovakian club Makkabi Brno. In November 1923, Makkabi played an exhibition game against SK Rapid Wien, crushing them 4-1 off two Schwarz goals. This brought him to the attention of Hakoah Vienna which signed him in December 1923.  He went on to play twelve games, scoring nine goals, through the remainder of the 1923–1924 season.  In the spring of 1926, Hakoah Vienna toured the United States. Impressed by the high pay and relatively minor anti-Semitism compared to Europe, Schwarz and several of his teammates decided to move to the U.S. following the conclusion of the tour.  Before he did so, he returned to Austria where Hakoah won the league championship.  Then in the summer of 1926, he left Europe for good to move to the United States.  When he arrived, he signed with the New York Giants of the American Soccer League (ASL).  In 1928, the ASL and United States Football Federation engaged in a struggle for dominance in the U.S.  Known as the “Soccer War”, this struggle led to USFA and FIFA declaring the ASL an “outlaw league”.  When that happened, Schwarz signed for Rangers F.C., but was unable to join the club due to labor restrictions in Great Britain.  After the Rangers deal fell through, Schwarz helped form New York Hakoah in the Eastern Professional Soccer League.  Hakoah took third in the league, but ran away with the 1929 National Challenge Cup.  Hakoah won both legs of the final over St. Louis Madison Kennel, with Schwarz scoring a goal in Hakoah's 3-0 second game victory.  Following the end of the “Soccer War” in 1929, the ASL and ESL merged with New York Hakoah of the ESL merging with Brooklyn Hakoah of the ASL to form the Hakoah All-Stars.  In 1931, Schwarz founded his own team, the New York Americans with whom he became both a player and coach.  In 1933, Schwarz and his teammates lost to Stix, Baer and Fuller F.C. in the final of the 1933 National Challenge Cup.  While the Americans defeated the St. Louis Shamrocks in the 1937 National Challenge Cup, Schwarz did not play in the final game as he had broken his leg in February 1937.  After that, he played sporadically, but continued to play occasional games with the Americans until at least 1951.

Paragraph 2: Santin's main title was in the Italian Formula Three Championship in 1984, in which he drove a Ralt-Alfa to four wins. From 1985 to 1988, Santin drove in the European Formula 3000 championship for many teams (Sanremo in 1985; Coloni, Sanremo, Lola Sport, Eddie Jordan Racing and Formula Team in 1986; Genoa in 1987 and Eddie Jordan Racing in 1988), without great results. His better results were two sixth places in Silverstone and Vallelunga in 1986, driving a Lola T86/50. His best start position was in Mugello in 1986, when he started from the second position, also driving a Lola T86/50.

Paragraph 3: His composition Scaldis and Antverpia (also referred to as Allegory of the Scheldt) of 1609 (Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp) is a key work of Janssens' Caravaggesque period.  It was commissioned by the Antwerp city magistrate to decorate the chimney in the city hall's Assembly Room where the Twelve Years' Truce between Spain and the Dutch Republic was signed on 9 April 1609.  Rubens also received a commission for the same occasion.  It was hoped that the Truce would bring new prosperity and trade to Antwerp, for which the city had traditionally relied on the river Scheldt. The subject of the work is therefore Scaldis (the river Scheldt) and Antverpia (the city of Antwerp). This work was made when Janssens' artistic powers had reached their peak.  The figure of Scaldis is inspired by the statute of the Tiber on the Capitoline Hill while the composition itself resembles Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. This work shows how Janssens' style had developed towards a classic academic beauty, harmonious in form and with an unbroken palette. The influence of Caravaggio is seen in the use of strong contrasts of light and shadow (chiaroscuro) to create expressive power, while the influence of the School of Bologna can be found in his search for noble classicism.  The preference of Janssens for sculptural form impairs the drama of the work as the figures are represented in frozen poses and expression.

Paragraph 7: On September 1, 2020, New York Yankees pitcher Aroldis Chapman threw a pitch that narrowly missed the head of Rays batter Mike Brosseau. After the game, Cash warned the Yankees that "I got a whole damn stable full of guys that throw 98 mph. Period." Cash received a one-game suspension for his comments. The 2020 Rays finished first in the AL East, and advanced to the 2020 World Series via playoff wins over the Toronto Blue Jays (2–0), Yankees (3–2), and Houston Astros (4–3). The Rays went on to lose the World Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers (4-2). In a controversial decision in game six, Cash removed starting pitcher and former Cy Young award winner Blake Snell from the game in the sixth inning while holding a 1–0 lead. Snell had only allowed two hits while striking out nine batters. While the move was typical of the season long strategy for the Rays, many have pointed to the move of inserting reliver Nick Anderson as the real detriment, and Anderson himself accepted much of the blame. A normally dominant Anderson may have been overworked, having pitched over 14 innings in the 2020 playoffs. The move resulted in Dodger's outfielder Mookie Betts to double with a runner on, setting up World Series MVP Corey Seager to drive in the go ahead runs. This move sparked controversy from many members of the media, fans and some players including Snell himself. Cash said after the game "I guess I regret it because it didn't work out. But I feel like the thought process was right... Every decision that's made, that end result has a pretty weighing factor in how you feel about it. If we had to do it over again, I would have the utmost confidence in Nick Anderson to get through that inning.". On September 25, 2021, the Rays clinched their second straight division title. Cash said about the accomplishment "We've proven we're the best team in the American League for six months. Let's keep grinding, and let's do it for one more month and then see where we go.". In the 2021 American League Division Series, they faced the Boston Red Sox, who they had won eleven out of nineteen matchups in their divisional matchups. The Rays won the first game 5–0 on the strength of good hitting, which had continued to the second game when they scored five runs in the first inning of Game 2. However, Boston roared back to a 14–6 victory to even the Series. Game 3 went thirteen innings and saw Boston win 6–4 that was marred by a fateful double that potentially cost Tampa Bay a run. Boston promptly won Game 4 in the ninth inning to bury the Rays and end their postseason. In the 2022 American League Wild Card, the Cleveland Guardians would sweep Cash’s Rays including in walk-off fashion by Oscar Gonzalez.

Paragraph 8: Sherman died on August 18, 2020 at the age of 64 of a heart attack at his home in Savannah, Georgia. The Red Hot Chili Peppers issued a statement on his death thanking him for "all times good, bad and in between". Red Hot Chili Peppers' bassist Flea would post his own personal tribute to Sherman on Instagram nearly a month later saying that while their relationship was "complicated", he cited Sherman as an influence on his music and his life saying he "played the most wicked guitar part on our song 'Mommy Where’s Daddy', a thing that influenced the way I heard rhythm forever. He taught me about diet, to eat clean and be conscious of my body. But more than anything, he was my friend. We came from very different backgrounds, had different world views, and it was hard for us to relate to one another often. But the excitement we shared over music, and the joy that bubbled up between us will last forever. Rest In Peace Sherm I love you."

Paragraph 10: The Puerto Rican professional wrestling style has been influenced by several countries, beginning with the settlement of local wrestlers in New York during the 1950s Great Migration. Among the first performers to adopt the American style was José Miguel Pérez Sr., who added an aerial element to it during an age where aerial maneuvers were uncommon. This hybrid version became common among Puerto Rican wrestlers that permanently settled in the United States, with Pedro Morales using a cannonball dive and Gilberto "Gypsy Joe" Meléndez being the first to jump successfully from the top of a steel cage onto an opponent, a move that later became associated with Jimmy Snuka. Morales' style was also influenced by his gimmick of "Latin brawler", heavily relying on stiff kicks and punches as well. These performers were among the first to introduce this way of performing to Puerto Rico during the early years of local professional wrestling. During the following years, more variations were introduced, particularly due to freelancers traveling abroad and learning different practices. The introduction of Mexican wrestlers in the 1960s slightly promoted the use of more aerial maneuvers, but the style did not become widespread. Similarly, Cuban wrestlers brought in after the Cuban Revolution brought their own style. However, Carlos Colón Sr. was among the most influential in shaping a local idiosyncrasy. He originally intended to work in the Mexican style that he learned early in his career, but being unable to fully adapt to it, decided to mix it with the traditional American variant. Later, after spending several years wrestling in Canada, he learned a more aggressive or "stiffer" approach than the one seen in American wrestling, while also learning the grappling practices used there.  Colón ultimately decided to further elevate the aggression of the "stiff" variant and combined it with the other styles, a practice that was quickly adopted by most of the Puerto Rican performers during the 1970s and 1980s. This version, which became the early forerunner to the modern Puerto Rican style, relied on heavy hits in a manner similar to its Japanese counterpart, but was more dependent on blading (the use of a blade to simulate an open injury) and the use of foreign objects to maximize the spectacle. The local circuit became notorious for its gimmick matches, and is credited with the introduction of fire as an element in professional wrestling. In subsequent years, the highly publicized feud between Colón and Abdullah the Butcher became recognized as one of the cornerstones in the creation of hardcore wrestling, having toured several of the National Wrestling Alliances territories and placing bloody performances. Their rivalry gained such momentum that it was commercialized with the release of a set of action figures in a series known as "Greatest Grudge Matches". A second aspect of the Puerto Rican style was subsequently introduced when locals became mainstream visitors in Mexican lucha libre promotions during the second half of the 1980s and early 1990s.

Paragraph 20: His composition Scaldis and Antverpia (also referred to as Allegory of the Scheldt) of 1609 (Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp) is a key work of Janssens' Caravaggesque period.  It was commissioned by the Antwerp city magistrate to decorate the chimney in the city hall's Assembly Room where the Twelve Years' Truce between Spain and the Dutch Republic was signed on 9 April 1609.  Rubens also received a commission for the same occasion.  It was hoped that the Truce would bring new prosperity and trade to Antwerp, for which the city had traditionally relied on the river Scheldt. The subject of the work is therefore Scaldis (the river Scheldt) and Antverpia (the city of Antwerp). This work was made when Janssens' artistic powers had reached their peak.  The figure of Scaldis is inspired by the statute of the Tiber on the Capitoline Hill while the composition itself resembles Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. This work shows how Janssens' style had developed towards a classic academic beauty, harmonious in form and with an unbroken palette. The influence of Caravaggio is seen in the use of strong contrasts of light and shadow (chiaroscuro) to create expressive power, while the influence of the School of Bologna can be found in his search for noble classicism.  The preference of Janssens for sculptural form impairs the drama of the work as the figures are represented in frozen poses and expression.

It was hoped that the Truce would bring new prosperity and trade to Antwerp, for which the city had traditionally relied on the river Scheldt. The subject of the work is therefore Scaldis (the river Scheldt) and Antverpia (the city of Antwerp). This work was made when Janssens' artistic powers had reached their peak.  The figure of Scaldis is inspired by the statute of the Tiber on the Capitoline Hill while the composition itself resembles Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. This work shows how Janssens' style had developed towards a classic academic beauty, harmonious in form and with an unbroken palette. The influence of Caravaggio is seen in the use of strong contrasts of light and shadow (chiaroscuro) to create expressive power, while the influence of the School of Bologna can be found in his search for noble classicism.  The preference of Janssens for sculptural form impairs the drama of the work as the figures are represented in frozen poses and expression.

Paragraph 22: Santin's main title was in the Italian Formula Three Championship in 1984, in which he drove a Ralt-Alfa to four wins. From 1985 to 1988, Santin drove in the European Formula 3000 championship for many teams (Sanremo in 1985; Coloni, Sanremo, Lola Sport, Eddie Jordan Racing and Formula Team in 1986; Genoa in 1987 and Eddie Jordan Racing in 1988), without great results. His better results were two sixth places in Silverstone and Vallelunga in 1986, driving a Lola T86/50. His best start position was in Mugello in 1986, when he started from the second position, also driving a Lola T86/50.

Paragraph 23: On October 12, a disturbance formed in the South China Sea, just off the eastern coast of Borneo. During the next few days, the system entered the border of the east Indian Ocean and intensified slightly. As soon as the system entered the eastern border of the Bay of Bengal on November 1, the IMD immediately upgraded the disturbance into a depression, because the system had already organized itself on October 31, a day before the system entered the IMD's area of responsibility. Later on November 1, the system began showing signs of further, but slow organization, as it continued moving west slowly. on November 2, the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MMD) also issued their first advisory on the system, and simply called it Depression. Later on that day, the IMD reported that the system had weakened into a low-pressure area, but they forecasted it to intensify into a depression soon again. Late on November 3, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system. Early on November 4, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) upgraded the area of low pressure to a depression giving it the designation "BOB 05". That day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) designated the system as Tropical Cyclone 05B. Early on November 5, the IMD upgraded Depression BOB 05 to a deep depression. Later, the deep depression strengthened further, prompting the IMD to upgrade it to a cyclonic storm, and was named "Jal." The storm continued to grow and became a severe cyclonic storm by November 6. Soon afterwards, it was upgraded to a Category 1 Tropical Cyclone by the JTWC. On November 7, Jal started weakening. Soon afterwards, the IMD reported that Jal weakened into a Cyclonic Storm. Later that day, the JTWC downgraded Jal into a Tropical storm. Late on the same day, the IMD reported that the storm weakened into a Deep Depression. As a deep depression, the system made landfall at Chennai, a few hours later. The system continued to weaken and became a depression by early hours of November 8. The depression continued to weaken until it dissipated into a remnant low on the same day. On that very same day the IMD said that there was a possibility of Jal's remnants regenerating over the north east Arabian Sea. As predicted, the system moved into the Arabian Sea without weakening by early November 9. However, instead of crossing the Arabian Sea, the system moved north along the western coast of India, restrengthening slightly, but not enough for it to regenerate completely. Within a few hours, the storm started moving inland, due to the prevailing winds. The system rapidly weakened as it moved farther inland over the next few days, causing severe flooding along the way. Early on November 12, the remnants of Cyclone Jal were completely absorbed by a non-tropical low over the Himalayas.

Paragraph 24: The Puerto Rican professional wrestling style has been influenced by several countries, beginning with the settlement of local wrestlers in New York during the 1950s Great Migration. Among the first performers to adopt the American style was José Miguel Pérez Sr., who added an aerial element to it during an age where aerial maneuvers were uncommon. This hybrid version became common among Puerto Rican wrestlers that permanently settled in the United States, with Pedro Morales using a cannonball dive and Gilberto "Gypsy Joe" Meléndez being the first to jump successfully from the top of a steel cage onto an opponent, a move that later became associated with Jimmy Snuka. Morales' style was also influenced by his gimmick of "Latin brawler", heavily relying on stiff kicks and punches as well. These performers were among the first to introduce this way of performing to Puerto Rico during the early years of local professional wrestling. During the following years, more variations were introduced, particularly due to freelancers traveling abroad and learning different practices. The introduction of Mexican wrestlers in the 1960s slightly promoted the use of more aerial maneuvers, but the style did not become widespread. Similarly, Cuban wrestlers brought in after the Cuban Revolution brought their own style. However, Carlos Colón Sr. was among the most influential in shaping a local idiosyncrasy. He originally intended to work in the Mexican style that he learned early in his career, but being unable to fully adapt to it, decided to mix it with the traditional American variant. Later, after spending several years wrestling in Canada, he learned a more aggressive or "stiffer" approach than the one seen in American wrestling, while also learning the grappling practices used there.  Colón ultimately decided to further elevate the aggression of the "stiff" variant and combined it with the other styles, a practice that was quickly adopted by most of the Puerto Rican performers during the 1970s and 1980s. This version, which became the early forerunner to the modern Puerto Rican style, relied on heavy hits in a manner similar to its Japanese counterpart, but was more dependent on blading (the use of a blade to simulate an open injury) and the use of foreign objects to maximize the spectacle. The local circuit became notorious for its gimmick matches, and is credited with the introduction of fire as an element in professional wrestling. In subsequent years, the highly publicized feud between Colón and Abdullah the Butcher became recognized as one of the cornerstones in the creation of hardcore wrestling, having toured several of the National Wrestling Alliances territories and placing bloody performances. Their rivalry gained such momentum that it was commercialized with the release of a set of action figures in a series known as "Greatest Grudge Matches". A second aspect of the Puerto Rican style was subsequently introduced when locals became mainstream visitors in Mexican lucha libre promotions during the second half of the 1980s and early 1990s.

Paragraph 25: Sherman died on August 18, 2020 at the age of 64 of a heart attack at his home in Savannah, Georgia. The Red Hot Chili Peppers issued a statement on his death thanking him for "all times good, bad and in between". Red Hot Chili Peppers' bassist Flea would post his own personal tribute to Sherman on Instagram nearly a month later saying that while their relationship was "complicated", he cited Sherman as an influence on his music and his life saying he "played the most wicked guitar part on our song 'Mommy Where’s Daddy', a thing that influenced the way I heard rhythm forever. He taught me about diet, to eat clean and be conscious of my body. But more than anything, he was my friend. We came from very different backgrounds, had different world views, and it was hard for us to relate to one another often. But the excitement we shared over music, and the joy that bubbled up between us will last forever. Rest In Peace Sherm I love you."

Paragraph 27: Schwarz began his professional career as a forward for Ferencvárosi TC when he was seventeen.  In 1922, Ferencvárosi won the Hungarian Cup.  That fall, Schwarz moved to Czechoslovakian club Makkabi Brno. In November 1923, Makkabi played an exhibition game against SK Rapid Wien, crushing them 4-1 off two Schwarz goals. This brought him to the attention of Hakoah Vienna which signed him in December 1923.  He went on to play twelve games, scoring nine goals, through the remainder of the 1923–1924 season.  In the spring of 1926, Hakoah Vienna toured the United States. Impressed by the high pay and relatively minor anti-Semitism compared to Europe, Schwarz and several of his teammates decided to move to the U.S. following the conclusion of the tour.  Before he did so, he returned to Austria where Hakoah won the league championship.  Then in the summer of 1926, he left Europe for good to move to the United States.  When he arrived, he signed with the New York Giants of the American Soccer League (ASL).  In 1928, the ASL and United States Football Federation engaged in a struggle for dominance in the U.S.  Known as the “Soccer War”, this struggle led to USFA and FIFA declaring the ASL an “outlaw league”.  When that happened, Schwarz signed for Rangers F.C., but was unable to join the club due to labor restrictions in Great Britain.  After the Rangers deal fell through, Schwarz helped form New York Hakoah in the Eastern Professional Soccer League.  Hakoah took third in the league, but ran away with the 1929 National Challenge Cup.  Hakoah won both legs of the final over St. Louis Madison Kennel, with Schwarz scoring a goal in Hakoah's 3-0 second game victory.  Following the end of the “Soccer War” in 1929, the ASL and ESL merged with New York Hakoah of the ESL merging with Brooklyn Hakoah of the ASL to form the Hakoah All-Stars.  In 1931, Schwarz founded his own team, the New York Americans with whom he became both a player and coach.  In 1933, Schwarz and his teammates lost to Stix, Baer and Fuller F.C. in the final of the 1933 National Challenge Cup.  While the Americans defeated the St. Louis Shamrocks in the 1937 National Challenge Cup, Schwarz did not play in the final game as he had broken his leg in February 1937.  After that, he played sporadically, but continued to play occasional games with the Americans until at least 1951.

Paragraph 30: On September 1, 2020, New York Yankees pitcher Aroldis Chapman threw a pitch that narrowly missed the head of Rays batter Mike Brosseau. After the game, Cash warned the Yankees that "I got a whole damn stable full of guys that throw 98 mph. Period." Cash received a one-game suspension for his comments. The 2020 Rays finished first in the AL East, and advanced to the 2020 World Series via playoff wins over the Toronto Blue Jays (2–0), Yankees (3–2), and Houston Astros (4–3). The Rays went on to lose the World Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers (4-2). In a controversial decision in game six, Cash removed starting pitcher and former Cy Young award winner Blake Snell from the game in the sixth inning while holding a 1–0 lead. Snell had only allowed two hits while striking out nine batters. While the move was typical of the season long strategy for the Rays, many have pointed to the move of inserting reliver Nick Anderson as the real detriment, and Anderson himself accepted much of the blame. A normally dominant Anderson may have been overworked, having pitched over 14 innings in the 2020 playoffs. The move resulted in Dodger's outfielder Mookie Betts to double with a runner on, setting up World Series MVP Corey Seager to drive in the go ahead runs. This move sparked controversy from many members of the media, fans and some players including Snell himself. Cash said after the game "I guess I regret it because it didn't work out. But I feel like the thought process was right... Every decision that's made, that end result has a pretty weighing factor in how you feel about it. If we had to do it over again, I would have the utmost confidence in Nick Anderson to get through that inning.". On September 25, 2021, the Rays clinched their second straight division title. Cash said about the accomplishment "We've proven we're the best team in the American League for six months. Let's keep grinding, and let's do it for one more month and then see where we go.". In the 2021 American League Division Series, they faced the Boston Red Sox, who they had won eleven out of nineteen matchups in their divisional matchups. The Rays won the first game 5–0 on the strength of good hitting, which had continued to the second game when they scored five runs in the first inning of Game 2. However, Boston roared back to a 14–6 victory to even the Series. Game 3 went thirteen innings and saw Boston win 6–4 that was marred by a fateful double that potentially cost Tampa Bay a run. Boston promptly won Game 4 in the ninth inning to bury the Rays and end their postseason. In the 2022 American League Wild Card, the Cleveland Guardians would sweep Cash’s Rays including in walk-off fashion by Oscar Gonzalez.

Paragraph 36: His composition Scaldis and Antverpia (also referred to as Allegory of the Scheldt) of 1609 (Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp) is a key work of Janssens' Caravaggesque period.  It was commissioned by the Antwerp city magistrate to decorate the chimney in the city hall's Assembly Room where the Twelve Years' Truce between Spain and the Dutch Republic was signed on 9 April 1609.  Rubens also received a commission for the same occasion.  It was hoped that the Truce would bring new prosperity and trade to Antwerp, for which the city had traditionally relied on the river Scheldt. The subject of the work is therefore Scaldis (the river Scheldt) and Antverpia (the city of Antwerp). This work was made when Janssens' artistic powers had reached their peak.  The figure of Scaldis is inspired by the statute of the Tiber on the Capitoline Hill while the composition itself resembles Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. This work shows how Janssens' style had developed towards a classic academic beauty, harmonious in form and with an unbroken palette. The influence of Caravaggio is seen in the use of strong contrasts of light and shadow (chiaroscuro) to create expressive power, while the influence of the School of Bologna can be found in his search for noble classicism.  The preference of Janssens for sculptural form impairs the drama of the work as the figures are represented in frozen poses and expression.

During the next few days, the system entered the border of the east Indian Ocean and intensified slightly. As soon as the system entered the eastern border of the Bay of Bengal on November 1, the IMD immediately upgraded the disturbance into a depression, because the system had already organized itself on October 31, a day before the system entered the IMD's area of responsibility. Later on November 1, the system began showing signs of further, but slow organization, as it continued moving west slowly. on November 2, the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MMD) also issued their first advisory on the system, and simply called it Depression. Later on that day, the IMD reported that the system had weakened into a low-pressure area, but they forecasted it to intensify into a depression soon again. Late on November 3, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system. Early on November 4, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) upgraded the area of low pressure to a depression giving it the designation "BOB 05". That day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) designated the system as Tropical Cyclone 05B. Early on November 5, the IMD upgraded Depression BOB 05 to a deep depression. Later, the deep depression strengthened further, prompting the IMD to upgrade it to a cyclonic storm, and was named "Jal." The storm continued to grow and became a severe cyclonic storm by November 6. Soon afterwards, it was upgraded to a Category 1 Tropical Cyclone by the JTWC. On November 7, Jal started weakening. Soon afterwards, the IMD reported that Jal weakened into a Cyclonic Storm. Later that day, the JTWC downgraded Jal into a Tropical storm. Late on the same day, the IMD reported that the storm weakened into a Deep Depression. As a deep depression, the system made landfall at Chennai, a few hours later. The system continued to weaken and became a depression by early hours of November 8. The depression continued to weaken until it dissipated into a remnant low on the same day. On that very same day the IMD said that there was a possibility of Jal's remnants regenerating over the north east Arabian Sea. As predicted, the system moved into the Arabian Sea without weakening by early November 9. However, instead of crossing the Arabian Sea, the system moved north along the western coast of India, restrengthening slightly, but not enough for it to regenerate completely. Within a few hours, the storm started moving inland, due to the prevailing winds. The system rapidly weakened as it moved farther inland over the next few days, causing severe flooding along the way. Early on November 12, the remnants of Cyclone Jal were completely absorbed by a non-tropical low over the Himalayas.

Paragraph 39: The Puerto Rican professional wrestling style has been influenced by several countries, beginning with the settlement of local wrestlers in New York during the 1950s Great Migration. Among the first performers to adopt the American style was José Miguel Pérez Sr., who added an aerial element to it during an age where aerial maneuvers were uncommon. This hybrid version became common among Puerto Rican wrestlers that permanently settled in the United States, with Pedro Morales using a cannonball dive and Gilberto "Gypsy Joe" Meléndez being the first to jump successfully from the top of a steel cage onto an opponent, a move that later became associated with Jimmy Snuka. Morales' style was also influenced by his gimmick of "Latin brawler", heavily relying on stiff kicks and punches as well. These performers were among the first to introduce this way of performing to Puerto Rico during the early years of local professional wrestling. During the following years, more variations were introduced, particularly due to freelancers traveling abroad and learning different practices. The introduction of Mexican wrestlers in the 1960s slightly promoted the use of more aerial maneuvers, but the style did not become widespread. Similarly, Cuban wrestlers brought in after the Cuban Revolution brought their own style. However, Carlos Colón Sr. was among the most influential in shaping a local idiosyncrasy. He originally intended to work in the Mexican style that he learned early in his career, but being unable to fully adapt to it, decided to mix it with the traditional American variant. Later, after spending several years wrestling in Canada, he learned a more aggressive or "stiffer" approach than the one seen in American wrestling, while also learning the grappling practices used there.  Colón ultimately decided to further elevate the aggression of the "stiff" variant and combined it with the other styles, a practice that was quickly adopted by most of the Puerto Rican performers during the 1970s and 1980s. This version, which became the early forerunner to the modern Puerto Rican style, relied on heavy hits in a manner similar to its Japanese counterpart, but was more dependent on blading (the use of a blade to simulate an open injury) and the use of foreign objects to maximize the spectacle. The local circuit became notorious for its gimmick matches, and is credited with the introduction of fire as an element in professional wrestling. In subsequent years, the highly publicized feud between Colón and Abdullah the Butcher became recognized as one of the cornerstones in the creation of hardcore wrestling, having toured several of the National Wrestling Alliances territories and placing bloody performances. Their rivalry gained such momentum that it was commercialized with the release of a set of action figures in a series known as "Greatest Grudge Matches". A second aspect of the Puerto Rican style was subsequently introduced when locals became mainstream visitors in Mexican lucha libre promotions during the second half of the 1980s and early 1990s.

Paragraph 40: On September 1, 2020, New York Yankees pitcher Aroldis Chapman threw a pitch that narrowly missed the head of Rays batter Mike Brosseau. After the game, Cash warned the Yankees that "I got a whole damn stable full of guys that throw 98 mph. Period." Cash received a one-game suspension for his comments. The 2020 Rays finished first in the AL East, and advanced to the 2020 World Series via playoff wins over the Toronto Blue Jays (2–0), Yankees (3–2), and Houston Astros (4–3). The Rays went on to lose the World Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers (4-2). In a controversial decision in game six, Cash removed starting pitcher and former Cy Young award winner Blake Snell from the game in the sixth inning while holding a 1–0 lead. Snell had only allowed two hits while striking out nine batters. While the move was typical of the season long strategy for the Rays, many have pointed to the move of inserting reliver Nick Anderson as the real detriment, and Anderson himself accepted much of the blame. A normally dominant Anderson may have been overworked, having pitched over 14 innings in the 2020 playoffs. The move resulted in Dodger's outfielder Mookie Betts to double with a runner on, setting up World Series MVP Corey Seager to drive in the go ahead runs. This move sparked controversy from many members of the media, fans and some players including Snell himself. Cash said after the game "I guess I regret it because it didn't work out. But I feel like the thought process was right... Every decision that's made, that end result has a pretty weighing factor in how you feel about it. If we had to do it over again, I would have the utmost confidence in Nick Anderson to get through that inning.". On September 25, 2021, the Rays clinched their second straight division title. Cash said about the accomplishment "We've proven we're the best team in the American League for six months. Let's keep grinding, and let's do it for one more month and then see where we go.". In the 2021 American League Division Series, they faced the Boston Red Sox, who they had won eleven out of nineteen matchups in their divisional matchups. The Rays won the first game 5–0 on the strength of good hitting, which had continued to the second game when they scored five runs in the first inning of Game 2. However, Boston roared back to a 14–6 victory to even the Series. Game 3 went thirteen innings and saw Boston win 6–4 that was marred by a fateful double that potentially cost Tampa Bay a run. Boston promptly won Game 4 in the ninth inning to bury the Rays and end their postseason. In the 2022 American League Wild Card, the Cleveland Guardians would sweep Cash’s Rays including in walk-off fashion by Oscar Gonzalez.
