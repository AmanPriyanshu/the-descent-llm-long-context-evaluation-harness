Paragraph 1: On the morning of 14 August 1898, Mangrove approached Caibarién and at about 10:55, when  east of the harbor there, sighted a large Spanish gunboat – which Mangrove′s crew identified as probably the gunboat Hernán Cortés – moored close inshore north of the harbor. Unable to bring both of her 6-pounders to bear at once, Mangrove opened fire on the gunboat with her port 6-pounder, firing slowly to get the range, and the gunboat immediately returned fire, firing her entire port broadside. After about five minutes, Mangrove switched to her starboard 6-pounder and continued firing slowly. All shots by both sides fell short. By 11:10, however, Mangrove was within range of the gunboat, and she steamed to the north and west for the next 25 minutes, keeping up a steady fire with her port 6-pounder. At 11:12, a small Spanish gunboat moored at Caibarién's city wharves joined the engagement, opening fire on Mangrove, but Mangrove was beyond her range; Mangrove fired a single round at her, but it fell short, and Mangrove then shifted fire back to the larger gunboat. At 11:25, Mangrove reversed course, steaming south and east and engaging the larger gunboat with her starboard 6-pounder, firing continuously with that gun until 11:45. At 11:27, she fired her 1-pounder at the larger gunboat as well, but the round fell short, and Mangrove made no further use of her 1-pounder during the engagement. The larger Spanish gunboat maintained a steady fire with her  guns as well and proved capable of reaching and even firing over Mangrove, so at 11:45 Mangrove′s commanding officer decided to cease fire and open the range in the hope of drawing the Spanish gunboat away from shore and give Mangrove a better chance of engaging her on more equal terms. The large Spanish gunboat also ceased fire as Mangrove drew away, but the smaller gunboat that had joined the engagement continued to fire at Mangrove ineffectively until 12:30. During the early afternoon, a Spanish party approached Mangrove aboard the smaller gunboat under a flag of truce and informed Mangroves crew that word had arrived that hostilities between Spain and the United States had ceased on 13 August. Mangrove thus had the distinction of fighting the last battle of the Spanish–American War, albeit on the day after the war officially ended. During the engagement she had fired 103 armor-piercing shells from her 6-pounder and one armor-piercing shell from her 1-pounder.

Paragraph 2: Typically, the system giving the guidance commands is tracking both the target and the missile or missiles via radar. It determines the positions and velocities of a target and a missile, and calculates whether their paths will intersect. If not, the guidance system will relay commands to a missile, telling it to move the fins in a way that steers in the direction needed to maneuver to an intercept course with the target. If the target maneuvers, the guidance system can sense this and update the missiles' course continuously to counteract such maneuvering. If the missile passes close to the target, either its own proximity or contact fuze will detonate the warhead, or the guidance system can estimate when the missile will pass near a target and send a detonation signal.

Paragraph 7: In the traditional Mongolian family, each son received a part of the family herd as he married, with the elder son receiving more than the younger son. The youngest son would remain in the parental tent caring for his parents, and after their death he would inherit the parental tent in addition to his own part of the herd. This inheritance system was mandated by law codes such as the Yassa, created by Genghis Khan. Likewise, each son inherited a part of the family's camping lands and pastures, with the elder son receiving more than the younger son. The eldest son inherited the farthest camping lands and pastures, and each son in turn inherited camping lands and pastures closer to the family tent until the youngest son inherited the camping lands and pastures immediately surrounding the family tent. Family units would often remain near each other and in close cooperation, though extended families would inevitably break up after a few generations. It is probable that the Yasa simply put into written law the principles of customary law. Nilgün Dalkesen wrote in Gender Roles and Women's Status in Central Asia and Anatolia between the Thirteenth and Sixteenth Centuries: "It is apparent that in many cases, for example in family instructions, the yasa tacitly accepted the principles of customary law and avoided any interference with them. For example, Riasanovsky said that killing the man or the woman in case of adultery is a good illustration. Yasa permitted the institutions of polygamy and concubinage so characteristic of southerly nomadic peoples. Children born of concubines were legitimate. Seniority of children derived their status from their mother. Eldest son received more than the youngest after the death of father. But the latter inherited the household of the father. Children of concubines also received a share in the inheritance, in accordance with the instructions of their father (or with custom)"

Seniority of children derived their status from their mother. Eldest son received more than the youngest after the death of father. But the latter inherited the household of the father. Children of concubines also received a share in the inheritance, in accordance with the instructions of their father (or with custom)"

Paragraph 16: On the morning of 14 August 1898, Mangrove approached Caibarién and at about 10:55, when  east of the harbor there, sighted a large Spanish gunboat – which Mangrove′s crew identified as probably the gunboat Hernán Cortés – moored close inshore north of the harbor. Unable to bring both of her 6-pounders to bear at once, Mangrove opened fire on the gunboat with her port 6-pounder, firing slowly to get the range, and the gunboat immediately returned fire, firing her entire port broadside. After about five minutes, Mangrove switched to her starboard 6-pounder and continued firing slowly. All shots by both sides fell short. By 11:10, however, Mangrove was within range of the gunboat, and she steamed to the north and west for the next 25 minutes, keeping up a steady fire with her port 6-pounder. At 11:12, a small Spanish gunboat moored at Caibarién's city wharves joined the engagement, opening fire on Mangrove, but Mangrove was beyond her range; Mangrove fired a single round at her, but it fell short, and Mangrove then shifted fire back to the larger gunboat. At 11:25, Mangrove reversed course, steaming south and east and engaging the larger gunboat with her starboard 6-pounder, firing continuously with that gun until 11:45. At 11:27, she fired her 1-pounder at the larger gunboat as well, but the round fell short, and Mangrove made no further use of her 1-pounder during the engagement. The larger Spanish gunboat maintained a steady fire with her  guns as well and proved capable of reaching and even firing over Mangrove, so at 11:45 Mangrove′s commanding officer decided to cease fire and open the range in the hope of drawing the Spanish gunboat away from shore and give Mangrove a better chance of engaging her on more equal terms. The large Spanish gunboat also ceased fire as Mangrove drew away, but the smaller gunboat that had joined the engagement continued to fire at Mangrove ineffectively until 12:30. During the early afternoon, a Spanish party approached Mangrove aboard the smaller gunboat under a flag of truce and informed Mangroves crew that word had arrived that hostilities between Spain and the United States had ceased on 13 August. Mangrove thus had the distinction of fighting the last battle of the Spanish–American War, albeit on the day after the war officially ended. During the engagement she had fired 103 armor-piercing shells from her 6-pounder and one armor-piercing shell from her 1-pounder.

Paragraph 17: In the traditional Mongolian family, each son received a part of the family herd as he married, with the elder son receiving more than the younger son. The youngest son would remain in the parental tent caring for his parents, and after their death he would inherit the parental tent in addition to his own part of the herd. This inheritance system was mandated by law codes such as the Yassa, created by Genghis Khan. Likewise, each son inherited a part of the family's camping lands and pastures, with the elder son receiving more than the younger son. The eldest son inherited the farthest camping lands and pastures, and each son in turn inherited camping lands and pastures closer to the family tent until the youngest son inherited the camping lands and pastures immediately surrounding the family tent. Family units would often remain near each other and in close cooperation, though extended families would inevitably break up after a few generations. It is probable that the Yasa simply put into written law the principles of customary law. Nilgün Dalkesen wrote in Gender Roles and Women's Status in Central Asia and Anatolia between the Thirteenth and Sixteenth Centuries: "It is apparent that in many cases, for example in family instructions, the yasa tacitly accepted the principles of customary law and avoided any interference with them. For example, Riasanovsky said that killing the man or the woman in case of adultery is a good illustration. Yasa permitted the institutions of polygamy and concubinage so characteristic of southerly nomadic peoples. Children born of concubines were legitimate. Seniority of children derived their status from their mother. Eldest son received more than the youngest after the death of father. But the latter inherited the household of the father. Children of concubines also received a share in the inheritance, in accordance with the instructions of their father (or with custom)"

Paragraph 18: Typically, the system giving the guidance commands is tracking both the target and the missile or missiles via radar. It determines the positions and velocities of a target and a missile, and calculates whether their paths will intersect. If not, the guidance system will relay commands to a missile, telling it to move the fins in a way that steers in the direction needed to maneuver to an intercept course with the target. If the target maneuvers, the guidance system can sense this and update the missiles' course continuously to counteract such maneuvering. If the missile passes close to the target, either its own proximity or contact fuze will detonate the warhead, or the guidance system can estimate when the missile will pass near a target and send a detonation signal.
