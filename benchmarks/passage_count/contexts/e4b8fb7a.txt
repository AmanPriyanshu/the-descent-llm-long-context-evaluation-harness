Paragraph 1: The most basic material for the forming web is polyvinyl chloride (PVC).  The principal advantages of PVC are the low cost and the ease of thermoforming. The main disadvantages are the poor barrier against moisture ingress and oxygen ingress. In the case of blister packaging the PVC sheet does not contain any plasticizer and is sometimes referred to as Rigid PVC or RPVC. In the absence of plasticizers, PVC blisters offer structural rigidity and physical protection for the pharmaceutical dosage form. On the other hand, the blister cavity must remain accessible by the push-through effect and the formed web may not be too hard to collapse when pressed upon; for this reason the PVC sheet thickness is typically chosen between 200µ to 300µ depending on the cavity size and shape. Most PVC sheets for pharmaceutical blisters are 250µ or 0.250 mm in thickness. Typical values for the Water Vapor Transmission Rate (WVTR or MVTR) of a 250µ PVC film are around 3.0 g/m2/day measured at 38 °C/90% RH and the Oxygen Transmission Rate (OTR) is around 20 mL/m2/day. In order to overcome the lack of barrier properties of PVC film, it can be coated with PVDC or laminated to PCTFE or COC to increase the protective properties. Multi-layer blister films based on PVC are often used for pharmaceutical blister packaging, whereby the PVC serves as the thermoformable backbone of the structure. Also, the PVC layer can be colored with pigments and/or UV filters. The European Pharmacopoeia (Ph Eur) references the requirements for PVC blister packs for pharmaceutical primary packaging in the monograph EP 3.1.11 "MATERIALS BASED ON NON-PLASTICISED POLY(VINYL CHLORIDE) FOR CONTAINERS FOR DRY DOSAGE FORMS FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION". In order to be suitable for pharmaceutical blister packs, the PVC formulation also needs to comply with the US Pharmacopoeia <661>; EU food legislation; US 21.CFR and Japanese food contact requirements.

Paragraph 2: Curtis appreciated the beauty and uniqueness of Mount Rainier so much that for several decades he directed his appreciation for scenic beauty and his efforts at regional boosterism and combined them into the development of Mount Rainier National Park. Curtis was a founding member of the Mountaineers, a mountain-climbing group which also promoted the preservation of wilderness areas. Curtis was active in the affairs of the club for the first several years after its founding in 1906. He led the Mountaineers on climbs up Mount Rainier and organized a committee within the club to deal with the Mount Rainier National Park. Curtis said: One comes more intimately in touch with the mountains when he travels the trails. In the valleys the forests seem lower, the giant trees rise from one's side to tremendous heights and the lower growth reaches out a friendly hand to bid you welcome; but it is on the untrodden mountain heights that the traveler receives a true reward for his toil. Here where vegetation makes its last stand amid a world of ice and snow, with the lower world stretching away to the distant horizon, nature unfolds in all her beauty.

Paragraph 6: [West Hollywood, California] auto customizer George Barris was given four weeks to supply vehicles for the film that was made from a left over Munster Koach fiberglass body. The top was removed, the rear engine was moved back in the square tube frame, then the second  engine was placed in front of the rear engine. The body after finished altering it, was channeled over frame. The body was cut after the first doors, then the rear section of the body was moved forward. They cut out the middle doors from the Munster Koach body, They then slid the whole rear the body forward and epoxied it. After this was done; both the small third doors and the front doors; were removed. Then they were epoxied together and the inside was reinforced with plywood. Then foam rubber was added to cover over the plywood. Next they upholstered in  gold flake star Naugahyde on the doors and spare tire carriers. The top in back is just side pieces, so a lid had to go over them to get the side pieces to fit. The middle of the top is used for two purposes; 1).to pull off to eject a person; like it happened with Jonathan Daily in Out of Sight to land in the side car of a Flush motorcycle. 2). When this steel top was put on in the middle; it served as a hardtop. A beautiful headdress of gold fringes; came off two inches from the front windshield. The rectangular lid was boxed on the sides. It was in this steel lid; that this golden headdress with fringes; on both left and right sides; also two inches off both sides; like the windshield. The windshield frame was angled forward, with another frame to meet the top of windshield frame to make an open triangle. The car was called "The ZZR" that was equipped with a variety of weapons in the manner of James Bond's customized Aston Martin DB-5 in Goldfinger. The $22,000 ZZR featured two 325 CID Buick engines bored out to 340 CID, mounted in tandem with a Buick two-speed automatic transmission with  high raised manifold on each engine with one carburetor per engine with a four holed Hilborn injector scoop, we just obtained, and we still need, two sets of four injector baffles and two sets linkages for each Hilborn injector scoops mentioned. The front scoop was higher because it had a Cadillac air cleaner underneath it. Bias tires mounted on 11" Rader Star Mags front, which he still need, the peoples help, in obtaining  sizes 15", since we already, have Firestone tires to fit these, after we buy the tires. and Rader one ribbed in the rear.  Mick Thompson dirt tires were fifteen inches wide in rear. A Cal-Custom kick channeled is mounted on rectangular tube frame with dual radiators. The brass custom grill cost $1,000 to make. The French Cibie headlights are mounted vertically between the fenders in specially designed nose with headlight shell, painted House of Kolor Kandy Dark Purple to match the rear fenders. The rest of the body is House of Kolor Pagan Gold. A complete arsenal in the rear trunk area is stocked with handguns, tear gas, hand grenades, telescopic machine gun, tar squirter, feather blow gun, and “skid juice” spray nozzle. Rear fenders house flame throwers, bullets never shot from the gun barrels inserted in the front tear drop front fenders. A model kit of the ZZR was made by AMT. Dox of Dox Art Factory in Italy owns the copyrights and both the original AMT drafting blueprints and Barris Kustoms The ZZR. The ZZR is going to be restored after 50 years; then make a European Circuit; then shown on the USA Circuit of car shows before returning to Italy.

Paragraph 10: From 1882 through 1897 newspaper reports refer to this competition consistently as 'The Leinster Challenge Cup'. From 1898 through 2006, press reports refer to the competition as 'The Leinster Senior Cup'. How and why did this change in title come about? The change in reference title probably had more to do with semantics rather than any change(s) in the rules governing the competition. At a General Meeting of the Leinster Branch of the I.R.F.U. held in the Wicklow Hotel on 11 November 1888, a resolution was adopted to inaugurate a Leinster Junior Cup competition on the same basis as applied to the Leinster Challenge Cup. Following the Hon. Treasurer's report to the Annual General Meeting a month earlier, it had been proposed that the Leinster Branch purchase a 'Challenge Cup' for such competition. At the Leinster Branch A.G.M in October 1891, a motion that the 2nd XVs of Senior Clubs be allowed to compete in the Leinster Junior Cup was rejected. Essentially the same motion returned the Leinster Branch AGM in October 1895, but was amended to refer the matter to a subcommittee to draft rules to govern the proposed competition under which the latter might be approved and discussion adjourned to the next General Meeting. At the reconvened meeting in November 1895, delegates were informed that the original motion had been withdrawn because of intense opposition. The meeting then reconstituted itself as a special meeting to consider a new resolution "that a Cup be presented by the Leinster Branch for competition amongst Second Fifteens of senior clubs on a league basis". After much discussion and consideration of umpteen amendments and counter proposals, the final phrase of the original motion was amended to read "amongst Junior Clubs and Second Fifteens of senior clubs on a league basis". This was passed unanimously. Thus the Leinster Branch I.R.F.U. from the 1886-87 season now had a Leinster Junior Cup, the winners of which received a Challenge Cup, a Junior League Cup for Junior Clubs and the 2nd XVs of Senior Clubs, and a Leinster Challenge Cup, contested by Senior Clubs. Thus, to avoid confusion in reports of competitions, the Leinster Challenge Cup became referred to as the Leinster Senior Cup, the winners of which were presented with the original Challenge Cup.

Typical values for the Water Vapor Transmission Rate (WVTR or MVTR) of a 250µ PVC film are around 3.0 g/m2/day measured at 38 °C/90% RH and the Oxygen Transmission Rate (OTR) is around 20 mL/m2/day. In order to overcome the lack of barrier properties of PVC film, it can be coated with PVDC or laminated to PCTFE or COC to increase the protective properties. Multi-layer blister films based on PVC are often used for pharmaceutical blister packaging, whereby the PVC serves as the thermoformable backbone of the structure. Also, the PVC layer can be colored with pigments and/or UV filters. The European Pharmacopoeia (Ph Eur) references the requirements for PVC blister packs for pharmaceutical primary packaging in the monograph EP 3.1.11 "MATERIALS BASED ON NON-PLASTICISED POLY(VINYL CHLORIDE) FOR CONTAINERS FOR DRY DOSAGE FORMS FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION". In order to be suitable for pharmaceutical blister packs, the PVC formulation also needs to comply with the US Pharmacopoeia <661>; EU food legislation; US 21.CFR and Japanese food contact requirements.

Paragraph 19: From 1882 through 1897 newspaper reports refer to this competition consistently as 'The Leinster Challenge Cup'. From 1898 through 2006, press reports refer to the competition as 'The Leinster Senior Cup'. How and why did this change in title come about? The change in reference title probably had more to do with semantics rather than any change(s) in the rules governing the competition. At a General Meeting of the Leinster Branch of the I.R.F.U. held in the Wicklow Hotel on 11 November 1888, a resolution was adopted to inaugurate a Leinster Junior Cup competition on the same basis as applied to the Leinster Challenge Cup. Following the Hon. Treasurer's report to the Annual General Meeting a month earlier, it had been proposed that the Leinster Branch purchase a 'Challenge Cup' for such competition. At the Leinster Branch A.G.M in October 1891, a motion that the 2nd XVs of Senior Clubs be allowed to compete in the Leinster Junior Cup was rejected. Essentially the same motion returned the Leinster Branch AGM in October 1895, but was amended to refer the matter to a subcommittee to draft rules to govern the proposed competition under which the latter might be approved and discussion adjourned to the next General Meeting. At the reconvened meeting in November 1895, delegates were informed that the original motion had been withdrawn because of intense opposition. The meeting then reconstituted itself as a special meeting to consider a new resolution "that a Cup be presented by the Leinster Branch for competition amongst Second Fifteens of senior clubs on a league basis". After much discussion and consideration of umpteen amendments and counter proposals, the final phrase of the original motion was amended to read "amongst Junior Clubs and Second Fifteens of senior clubs on a league basis". This was passed unanimously. Thus the Leinster Branch I.R.F.U. from the 1886-87 season now had a Leinster Junior Cup, the winners of which received a Challenge Cup, a Junior League Cup for Junior Clubs and the 2nd XVs of Senior Clubs, and a Leinster Challenge Cup, contested by Senior Clubs. Thus, to avoid confusion in reports of competitions, the Leinster Challenge Cup became referred to as the Leinster Senior Cup, the winners of which were presented with the original Challenge Cup.

Paragraph 20: The most basic material for the forming web is polyvinyl chloride (PVC).  The principal advantages of PVC are the low cost and the ease of thermoforming. The main disadvantages are the poor barrier against moisture ingress and oxygen ingress. In the case of blister packaging the PVC sheet does not contain any plasticizer and is sometimes referred to as Rigid PVC or RPVC. In the absence of plasticizers, PVC blisters offer structural rigidity and physical protection for the pharmaceutical dosage form. On the other hand, the blister cavity must remain accessible by the push-through effect and the formed web may not be too hard to collapse when pressed upon; for this reason the PVC sheet thickness is typically chosen between 200µ to 300µ depending on the cavity size and shape.

Paragraph 22: Curtis appreciated the beauty and uniqueness of Mount Rainier so much that for several decades he directed his appreciation for scenic beauty and his efforts at regional boosterism and combined them into the development of Mount Rainier National Park. Curtis was a founding member of the Mountaineers, a mountain-climbing group which also promoted the preservation of wilderness areas. Curtis was active in the affairs of the club for the first several years after its founding in 1906. He led the Mountaineers on climbs up Mount Rainier and organized a committee within the club to deal with the Mount Rainier National Park. Curtis said: One comes more intimately in touch with the mountains when he travels the trails. In the valleys the forests seem lower, the giant trees rise from one's side to tremendous heights and the lower growth reaches out a friendly hand to bid you welcome; but it is on the untrodden mountain heights that the traveler receives a true reward for his toil. Here where vegetation makes its last stand amid a world of ice and snow, with the lower world stretching away to the distant horizon, nature unfolds in all her beauty.

Paragraph 24: [West Hollywood, California] auto customizer George Barris was given four weeks to supply vehicles for the film that was made from a left over Munster Koach fiberglass body. The top was removed, the rear engine was moved back in the square tube frame, then the second  engine was placed in front of the rear engine. The body after finished altering it, was channeled over frame. The body was cut after the first doors, then the rear section of the body was moved forward. They cut out the middle doors from the Munster Koach body, They then slid the whole rear the body forward and epoxied it. After this was done; both the small third doors and the front doors; were removed. Then they were epoxied together and the inside was reinforced with plywood. Then foam rubber was added to cover over the plywood. Next they upholstered in  gold flake star Naugahyde on the doors and spare tire carriers. The top in back is just side pieces, so a lid had to go over them to get the side pieces to fit. The middle of the top is used for two purposes; 1).to pull off to eject a person; like it happened with Jonathan Daily in Out of Sight to land in the side car of a Flush motorcycle. 2). When this steel top was put on in the middle; it served as a hardtop. A beautiful headdress of gold fringes; came off two inches from the front windshield. The rectangular lid was boxed on the sides. It was in this steel lid; that this golden headdress with fringes; on both left and right sides; also two inches off both sides; like the windshield. The windshield frame was angled forward, with another frame to meet the top of windshield frame to make an open triangle. The car was called "The ZZR" that was equipped with a variety of weapons in the manner of James Bond's customized Aston Martin DB-5 in Goldfinger. The $22,000 ZZR featured two 325 CID Buick engines bored out to 340 CID, mounted in tandem with a Buick two-speed automatic transmission with  high raised manifold on each engine with one carburetor per engine with a four holed Hilborn injector scoop, we just obtained, and we still need, two sets of four injector baffles and two sets linkages for each Hilborn injector scoops mentioned. The front scoop was higher because it had a Cadillac air cleaner underneath it. Bias tires mounted on 11" Rader Star Mags front, which he still need, the peoples help, in obtaining  sizes 15", since we already, have Firestone tires to fit these, after we buy the tires. and Rader one ribbed in the rear.  Mick Thompson dirt tires were fifteen inches wide in rear. A Cal-Custom kick channeled is mounted on rectangular tube frame with dual radiators. The brass custom grill cost $1,000 to make. The French Cibie headlights are mounted vertically between the fenders in specially designed nose with headlight shell, painted House of Kolor Kandy Dark Purple to match the rear fenders. The rest of the body is House of Kolor Pagan Gold. A complete arsenal in the rear trunk area is stocked with handguns, tear gas, hand grenades, telescopic machine gun, tar squirter, feather blow gun, and “skid juice” spray nozzle. Rear fenders house flame throwers, bullets never shot from the gun barrels inserted in the front tear drop front fenders. A model kit of the ZZR was made by AMT. Dox of Dox Art Factory in Italy owns the copyrights and both the original AMT drafting blueprints and Barris Kustoms The ZZR. The ZZR is going to be restored after 50 years; then make a European Circuit; then shown on the USA Circuit of car shows before returning to Italy.

Paragraph 34: Curtis appreciated the beauty and uniqueness of Mount Rainier so much that for several decades he directed his appreciation for scenic beauty and his efforts at regional boosterism and combined them into the development of Mount Rainier National Park. Curtis was a founding member of the Mountaineers, a mountain-climbing group which also promoted the preservation of wilderness areas. Curtis was active in the affairs of the club for the first several years after its founding in 1906. He led the Mountaineers on climbs up Mount Rainier and organized a committee within the club to deal with the Mount Rainier National Park. Curtis said: One comes more intimately in touch with the mountains when he travels the trails.

Paragraph 36: From 1882 through 1897 newspaper reports refer to this competition consistently as 'The Leinster Challenge Cup'. From 1898 through 2006, press reports refer to the competition as 'The Leinster Senior Cup'. How and why did this change in title come about? The change in reference title probably had more to do with semantics rather than any change(s) in the rules governing the competition. At a General Meeting of the Leinster Branch of the I.R.F.U. held in the Wicklow Hotel on 11 November 1888, a resolution was adopted to inaugurate a Leinster Junior Cup competition on the same basis as applied to the Leinster Challenge Cup. Following the Hon. Treasurer's report to the Annual General Meeting a month earlier, it had been proposed that the Leinster Branch purchase a 'Challenge Cup' for such competition. At the Leinster Branch A.G.M in October 1891, a motion that the 2nd XVs of Senior Clubs be allowed to compete in the Leinster Junior Cup was rejected. Essentially the same motion returned the Leinster Branch AGM in October 1895, but was amended to refer the matter to a subcommittee to draft rules to govern the proposed competition under which the latter might be approved and discussion adjourned to the next General Meeting. At the reconvened meeting in November 1895, delegates were informed that the original motion had been withdrawn because of intense opposition. The meeting then reconstituted itself as a special meeting to consider a new resolution "that a Cup be presented by the Leinster Branch for competition amongst Second Fifteens of senior clubs on a league basis". After much discussion and consideration of umpteen amendments and counter proposals, the final phrase of the original motion was amended to read "amongst Junior Clubs and Second Fifteens of senior clubs on a league basis". This was passed unanimously. Thus the Leinster Branch I.R.F.U. from the 1886-87 season now had a Leinster Junior Cup, the winners of which received a Challenge Cup, a Junior League Cup for Junior Clubs and the 2nd XVs of Senior Clubs, and a Leinster Challenge Cup, contested by Senior Clubs. Thus, to avoid confusion in reports of competitions, the Leinster Challenge Cup became referred to as the Leinster Senior Cup, the winners of which were presented with the original Challenge Cup.

Paragraph 37: [West Hollywood, California] auto customizer George Barris was given four weeks to supply vehicles for the film that was made from a left over Munster Koach fiberglass body. The top was removed, the rear engine was moved back in the square tube frame, then the second  engine was placed in front of the rear engine. The body after finished altering it, was channeled over frame. The body was cut after the first doors, then the rear section of the body was moved forward. They cut out the middle doors from the Munster Koach body, They then slid the whole rear the body forward and epoxied it. After this was done; both the small third doors and the front doors; were removed. Then they were epoxied together and the inside was reinforced with plywood. Then foam rubber was added to cover over the plywood. Next they upholstered in  gold flake star Naugahyde on the doors and spare tire carriers. The top in back is just side pieces, so a lid had to go over them to get the side pieces to fit. The middle of the top is used for two purposes; 1).to pull off to eject a person; like it happened with Jonathan Daily in Out of Sight to land in the side car of a Flush motorcycle. 2). When this steel top was put on in the middle; it served as a hardtop. A beautiful headdress of gold fringes; came off two inches from the front windshield. The rectangular lid was boxed on the sides. It was in this steel lid; that this golden headdress with fringes; on both left and right sides; also two inches off both sides; like the windshield. The windshield frame was angled forward, with another frame to meet the top of windshield frame to make an open triangle. The car was called "The ZZR" that was equipped with a variety of weapons in the manner of James Bond's customized Aston Martin DB-5 in Goldfinger. The $22,000 ZZR featured two 325 CID Buick engines bored out to 340 CID, mounted in tandem with a Buick two-speed automatic transmission with  high raised manifold on each engine with one carburetor per engine with a four holed Hilborn injector scoop, we just obtained, and we still need, two sets of four injector baffles and two sets linkages for each Hilborn injector scoops mentioned. The front scoop was higher because it had a Cadillac air cleaner underneath it. Bias tires mounted on 11" Rader Star Mags front, which he still need, the peoples help, in obtaining  sizes 15", since we already, have Firestone tires to fit these, after we buy the tires. and Rader one ribbed in the rear.  Mick Thompson dirt tires were fifteen inches wide in rear. A Cal-Custom kick channeled is mounted on rectangular tube frame with dual radiators. The brass custom grill cost $1,000 to make. The French Cibie headlights are mounted vertically between the fenders in specially designed nose with headlight shell, painted House of Kolor Kandy Dark Purple to match the rear fenders. The rest of the body is House of Kolor Pagan Gold. A complete arsenal in the rear trunk area is stocked with handguns, tear gas, hand grenades, telescopic machine gun, tar squirter, feather blow gun, and “skid juice” spray nozzle. Rear fenders house flame throwers, bullets never shot from the gun barrels inserted in the front tear drop front fenders. A model kit of the ZZR was made by AMT. Dox of Dox Art Factory in Italy owns the copyrights and both the original AMT drafting blueprints and Barris Kustoms The ZZR. The ZZR is going to be restored after 50 years; then make a European Circuit; then shown on the USA Circuit of car shows before returning to Italy.

Paragraph 47: The most basic material for the forming web is polyvinyl chloride (PVC).  The principal advantages of PVC are the low cost and the ease of thermoforming. The main disadvantages are the poor barrier against moisture ingress and oxygen ingress. In the case of blister packaging the PVC sheet does not contain any plasticizer and is sometimes referred to as Rigid PVC or RPVC. In the absence of plasticizers, PVC blisters offer structural rigidity and physical protection for the pharmaceutical dosage form. On the other hand, the blister cavity must remain accessible by the push-through effect and the formed web may not be too hard to collapse when pressed upon; for this reason the PVC sheet thickness is typically chosen between 200µ to 300µ depending on the cavity size and shape. Most PVC sheets for pharmaceutical blisters are 250µ or 0.250 mm in thickness. Typical values for the Water Vapor Transmission Rate (WVTR or MVTR) of a 250µ PVC film are around 3.0 g/m2/day measured at 38 °C/90% RH and the Oxygen Transmission Rate (OTR) is around 20 mL/m2/day. In order to overcome the lack of barrier properties of PVC film, it can be coated with PVDC or laminated to PCTFE or COC to increase the protective properties. Multi-layer blister films based on PVC are often used for pharmaceutical blister packaging, whereby the PVC serves as the thermoformable backbone of the structure. Also, the PVC layer can be colored with pigments and/or UV filters. The European Pharmacopoeia (Ph Eur) references the requirements for PVC blister packs for pharmaceutical primary packaging in the monograph EP 3.1.11 "MATERIALS BASED ON NON-PLASTICISED POLY(VINYL CHLORIDE) FOR CONTAINERS FOR DRY DOSAGE FORMS FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION". In order to be suitable for pharmaceutical blister packs, the PVC formulation also needs to comply with the US Pharmacopoeia <661>; EU food legislation; US 21.CFR and Japanese food contact requirements.
