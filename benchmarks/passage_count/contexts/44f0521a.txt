Paragraph 2: Although Trimble avoided the amputation of his wounded leg, his rehabilitation proceeded slowly. For months after, doctors periodically found bone fragments that had to be extracted. By November, he developed camp erysipelas and a probable case of osteomyelitis, and his ambitions for elevation to division command were on hold until he was well enough to return to active duty. He made his desire for promotion abundantly clear to his colleagues, and in one instance before the army moved north to Manassas, he was quoted as saying (probably humorously), "General Jackson, before this war is over, I intend to be a Major General or a corpse!" Jackson wrote a strong letter of recommendation, although he tempered it by including the sentence "I do not regard him as a good disciplinarian." Trimble engaged in a letterwriting campaign from his sick bed to obtain his promotion and to challenge Jackson's claim. He wrote to Adjutant General Samuel Cooper, "If I am to have promotion I want it at once and I particularly request, that my date may be from 26 August, the date of the capture of Manassas." (During this period Trimble also feuded with Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart about their conflicting reports of the battle and who bore primary responsibility for the seizure of the Union supply depot.)

Paragraph 4: The sixth match announced for the iPPV pits Chikara Grand Champion Eddie Kingston, Jigsaw and The Colony of Fire Ant, Green Ant and Soldier Ant against Chikara's top rudo alliance Gekido of 17, assailAnt, combatAnt, deviAnt and The Shard in a ten-man tag team match. On February 26, an eight-man tag team match, where Fire Ant, Jigsaw, Mike Quackenbush and Soldier Ant faced Jakob Hammermeier, Kobald, Tim Donst and Obariyon was interrupted, when the tecnicos were attacked by five unidentified men wearing masks. Posting videos on YouTube, the five men later revealed themselves as 17, The Shard and The Swarm (assailAnt, combatAnt and deviAnt), supposed equivalents of Quackenbush, Jigsaw and The Colony, respectively. The group, named Gekido, wrestled their first matches on March 24, with combatAnt and deviAnt winning a four-way tag team match and 17 and The Shard defeating Jigsaw and Quackenbush in a tag team match, with 17 submitting Quackenbush for the win. Quackenbush, who legitimately broke his wrist during the match, later claimed to have figured out that the members of The Swarm were "Jose and two Franks", wrestlers who in the past trained under him at the Chikara Wrestle Factory, but dropped out before graduating. In a blog entry, deviAnt confirmed that Quackenbush had gotten their identities right, claiming that they were treated like slaves at the Chikara Wrestle Factory, while also feeling that Chikara, at the time, was a sinking ship. The Shard also revealed to have had a personal relationship with Jigsaw, claiming that the two were trained together at Kevin Knight's Independent Wrestling Federation (IWF) wrestling school, but turned down Jigsaw's invite to join him at the Chikara Wrestle Factory, when Jigsaw and, among others, Eddie Kingston were kicked out of IWF in 2002. Finally, 17 revealed that he had never met Quackenbush, but had been following his career, training under the same people and considered himself just as talented as him, but was never able to receive similar acclaim and attention. His name was a reference to the seventeen "forgotten submission holds" that even Quackenbush, nicknamed "The Master of a Thousand Holds", was supposedly unfamiliar with. All five men claimed to be more talented than any Chikara wrestler, but the public had been fooled by the colorful characters and masks of the likes of The Colony and Jigsaw. With rudo referee Derek Sabato acting as the liaison between Chikara and Gekido, the promotion eventually agreed to the group's demands in order to stop the attacks and made 17, assailAnt, combatAnt, deviAnt and The Shard official members of Chikara's roster. Following their debuts, Gekido remained undefeated inside Chikara ring, before Jigsaw submitted combatAnt in an eight-man tag team match on April 28.

Paragraph 5: Davies was director of rugby at Leeds Tykes from 1996 to 2006 before resigning his post. When he first took charge in 1996 Leeds where in National Division Four, where in his debut season the club finished third, two places above the previous season. In 1998, they were promoted up to the Allied Dunbar Premiership Two finishing in sixth place, before finishing runner-up to Rotherham in 1999–2000. In 2001, Davies lead Leeds to the National Division One title, losing just two games all season. They were therefore promoted to the top elite tournament for the 2001–02 English Premiership season. Despite winning six games during the season, and performed well in the 2001–02 European Challenge Cup, they finished bottom of the table, but avoided relegation due to the inadequacies of Rotherham's ground. In the 2002–03 English Premiership season, Davies led Leeds to fifth with 12 victories, and the second round of the 2002–03 European Challenge Cup. In 2004 Leeds finished 11th, but did however secure seven victories to place them 34 points clear of relegated team Rotherham. In their debut season of the Heineken Cup, Leeds gained a single victory, a 29–20 win over Neath-Swansea Ospreys. Davies left his post at Leeds after they were relegated at the end of the 2005–06 English Premiership season. Davies said at the time: "I have no immediate plans to go elsewhere, rather I just feel it's time to take a break. I want to make it clear this mutual decision has nothing to do with the current situation at Leeds. It is after much soul searching and discussion with my family and Leeds Tykes that I have decided to resign my post."

Despite winning six games during the season, and performed well in the 2001–02 European Challenge Cup, they finished bottom of the table, but avoided relegation due to the inadequacies of Rotherham's ground. In the 2002–03 English Premiership season, Davies led Leeds to fifth with 12 victories, and the second round of the 2002–03 European Challenge Cup. In 2004 Leeds finished 11th, but did however secure seven victories to place them 34 points clear of relegated team Rotherham. In their debut season of the Heineken Cup, Leeds gained a single victory, a 29–20 win over Neath-Swansea Ospreys. Davies left his post at Leeds after they were relegated at the end of the 2005–06 English Premiership season. Davies said at the time: "I have no immediate plans to go elsewhere, rather I just feel it's time to take a break. I want to make it clear this mutual decision has nothing to do with the current situation at Leeds. It is after much soul searching and discussion with my family and Leeds Tykes that I have decided to resign my post."

Paragraph 18: The sixth match announced for the iPPV pits Chikara Grand Champion Eddie Kingston, Jigsaw and The Colony of Fire Ant, Green Ant and Soldier Ant against Chikara's top rudo alliance Gekido of 17, assailAnt, combatAnt, deviAnt and The Shard in a ten-man tag team match. On February 26, an eight-man tag team match, where Fire Ant, Jigsaw, Mike Quackenbush and Soldier Ant faced Jakob Hammermeier, Kobald, Tim Donst and Obariyon was interrupted, when the tecnicos were attacked by five unidentified men wearing masks. Posting videos on YouTube, the five men later revealed themselves as 17, The Shard and The Swarm (assailAnt, combatAnt and deviAnt), supposed equivalents of Quackenbush, Jigsaw and The Colony, respectively. The group, named Gekido, wrestled their first matches on March 24, with combatAnt and deviAnt winning a four-way tag team match and 17 and The Shard defeating Jigsaw and Quackenbush in a tag team match, with 17 submitting Quackenbush for the win. Quackenbush, who legitimately broke his wrist during the match, later claimed to have figured out that the members of The Swarm were "Jose and two Franks", wrestlers who in the past trained under him at the Chikara Wrestle Factory, but dropped out before graduating. In a blog entry, deviAnt confirmed that Quackenbush had gotten their identities right, claiming that they were treated like slaves at the Chikara Wrestle Factory, while also feeling that Chikara, at the time, was a sinking ship. The Shard also revealed to have had a personal relationship with Jigsaw, claiming that the two were trained together at Kevin Knight's Independent Wrestling Federation (IWF) wrestling school, but turned down Jigsaw's invite to join him at the Chikara Wrestle Factory, when Jigsaw and, among others, Eddie Kingston were kicked out of IWF in 2002. Finally, 17 revealed that he had never met Quackenbush, but had been following his career, training under the same people and considered himself just as talented as him, but was never able to receive similar acclaim and attention. His name was a reference to the seventeen "forgotten submission holds" that even Quackenbush, nicknamed "The Master of a Thousand Holds", was supposedly unfamiliar with. All five men claimed to be more talented than any Chikara wrestler, but the public had been fooled by the colorful characters and masks of the likes of The Colony and Jigsaw. With rudo referee Derek Sabato acting as the liaison between Chikara and Gekido, the promotion eventually agreed to the group's demands in order to stop the attacks and made 17, assailAnt, combatAnt, deviAnt and The Shard official members of Chikara's roster. Following their debuts, Gekido remained undefeated inside Chikara ring, before Jigsaw submitted combatAnt in an eight-man tag team match on April 28.

Paragraph 19: Davies was director of rugby at Leeds Tykes from 1996 to 2006 before resigning his post. When he first took charge in 1996 Leeds where in National Division Four, where in his debut season the club finished third, two places above the previous season. In 1998, they were promoted up to the Allied Dunbar Premiership Two finishing in sixth place, before finishing runner-up to Rotherham in 1999–2000.

Paragraph 21: Although Trimble avoided the amputation of his wounded leg, his rehabilitation proceeded slowly. For months after, doctors periodically found bone fragments that had to be extracted. By November, he developed camp erysipelas and a probable case of osteomyelitis, and his ambitions for elevation to division command were on hold until he was well enough to return to active duty. He made his desire for promotion abundantly clear to his colleagues, and in one instance before the army moved north to Manassas, he was quoted as saying (probably humorously), "General Jackson, before this war is over, I intend to be a Major General or a corpse!" Jackson wrote a strong letter of recommendation, although he tempered it by including the sentence "I do not regard him as a good disciplinarian." Trimble engaged in a letterwriting campaign from his sick bed to obtain his promotion and to challenge Jackson's claim. He wrote to Adjutant General Samuel Cooper, "If I am to have promotion I want it at once and I particularly request, that my date may be from 26 August, the date of the capture of Manassas." (During this period Trimble also feuded with Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart about their conflicting reports of the battle and who bore primary responsibility for the seizure of the Union supply depot.)

Paragraph 29: Timothy Donohoo of CBR.com said, "America has been a part of predominantly critically well-received books, including the aforementioned Young Avengers and appearances in Kate Bishop's Hawkeye title. While she has had loud detractors, it bears repeating that she also rapidly amassed a relatively large and vocal fanbase. Her woes, in part, can be attributed to increased profile coinciding with a time when comics fans have increasingly dug in about "politics" in comics and a particular contingent reacting with venom to what they insist is "forced diversity." As a character, America's usually shown as a somewhat stony individual, being more observant than obnoxious and talkative. These qualities made her a strong figure within the Young Avengers, standing alongside the similarly star-spangled Patriot. Working alongside older heroes like Carol Danvers in the book The Ultimates, her admiration and respect for them was ironically seen as a legacy character done right. Her costume, much like Kamala Khan's, is also a great blend of stylish and superheroic, perfect for a modern multiversal Marvel heroine." May Rude of Out asserted, "Chavez rose to popularity as a part of the Young Avengers team of teen superheroes, before later starring in her own comic series by Gabby Rivera. She’s long been a fan favorite, especially among queer people and Latin fans." Brian Truitt of USA Today stated that America Chavez is one of the characters "who deserve their own movie," saying, "this Latin-American teen lesbian superheroine could be a more groundbreaking choice. She’s bulletproof and super-strong, isn’t big on old-school good guys, and takes no guff. Miss America just sounds like a great movie title — or maybe she takes over the star-spangled shield if Marvel needs a new Captain America one day."  Zack Krajnyak of Screen Rant referred to the potential inclusion of Chavez in the MCU as "incredibly significant," stating that the addition of Miss America a "significant milestone" due to Chavez being a Latin-American LGBTQ character, and stated, "Many have hoped that America Chavez will play a large part in the MCU's future - and with the rumored inclusion of fellow Young Avengers Wiccan in WandaVision and Kate Bishop in Hawkeye, using the character as deep connective tissue seems increasingly likely. Should she truly make her entrance in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, much will be resting on America Chavez's shoulders. But if she is anything like her on-page counterpart, this multiverse-traversing powerhouse will light up the screen and then some."

Her costume, much like Kamala Khan's, is also a great blend of stylish and superheroic, perfect for a modern multiversal Marvel heroine." May Rude of Out asserted, "Chavez rose to popularity as a part of the Young Avengers team of teen superheroes, before later starring in her own comic series by Gabby Rivera. She’s long been a fan favorite, especially among queer people and Latin fans." Brian Truitt of USA Today stated that America Chavez is one of the characters "who deserve their own movie," saying, "this Latin-American teen lesbian superheroine could be a more groundbreaking choice. She’s bulletproof and super-strong, isn’t big on old-school good guys, and takes no guff. Miss America just sounds like a great movie title — or maybe she takes over the star-spangled shield if Marvel needs a new Captain America one day."  Zack Krajnyak of Screen Rant referred to the potential inclusion of Chavez in the MCU as "incredibly significant," stating that the addition of Miss America a "significant milestone" due to Chavez being a Latin-American LGBTQ character, and stated, "Many have hoped that America Chavez will play a large part in the MCU's future - and with the rumored inclusion of fellow Young Avengers Wiccan in WandaVision and Kate Bishop in Hawkeye, using the character as deep connective tissue seems increasingly likely. Should she truly make her entrance in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, much will be resting on America Chavez's shoulders. But if she is anything like her on-page counterpart, this multiverse-traversing powerhouse will light up the screen and then some."  

Paragraph 35: The sixth match announced for the iPPV pits Chikara Grand Champion Eddie Kingston, Jigsaw and The Colony of Fire Ant, Green Ant and Soldier Ant against Chikara's top rudo alliance Gekido of 17, assailAnt, combatAnt, deviAnt and The Shard in a ten-man tag team match. On February 26, an eight-man tag team match, where Fire Ant, Jigsaw, Mike Quackenbush and Soldier Ant faced Jakob Hammermeier, Kobald, Tim Donst and Obariyon was interrupted, when the tecnicos were attacked by five unidentified men wearing masks. Posting videos on YouTube, the five men later revealed themselves as 17, The Shard and The Swarm (assailAnt, combatAnt and deviAnt), supposed equivalents of Quackenbush, Jigsaw and The Colony, respectively. The group, named Gekido, wrestled their first matches on March 24, with combatAnt and deviAnt winning a four-way tag team match and 17 and The Shard defeating Jigsaw and Quackenbush in a tag team match, with 17 submitting Quackenbush for the win. Quackenbush, who legitimately broke his wrist during the match, later claimed to have figured out that the members of The Swarm were "Jose and two Franks", wrestlers who in the past trained under him at the Chikara Wrestle Factory, but dropped out before graduating. In a blog entry, deviAnt confirmed that Quackenbush had gotten their identities right, claiming that they were treated like slaves at the Chikara Wrestle Factory, while also feeling that Chikara, at the time, was a sinking ship. The Shard also revealed to have had a personal relationship with Jigsaw, claiming that the two were trained together at Kevin Knight's Independent Wrestling Federation (IWF) wrestling school, but turned down Jigsaw's invite to join him at the Chikara Wrestle Factory, when Jigsaw and, among others, Eddie Kingston were kicked out of IWF in 2002. Finally, 17 revealed that he had never met Quackenbush, but had been following his career, training under the same people and considered himself just as talented as him, but was never able to receive similar acclaim and attention. His name was a reference to the seventeen "forgotten submission holds" that even Quackenbush, nicknamed "The Master of a Thousand Holds", was supposedly unfamiliar with. All five men claimed to be more talented than any Chikara wrestler, but the public had been fooled by the colorful characters and masks of the likes of The Colony and Jigsaw. With rudo referee Derek Sabato acting as the liaison between Chikara and Gekido, the promotion eventually agreed to the group's demands in order to stop the attacks and made 17, assailAnt, combatAnt, deviAnt and The Shard official members of Chikara's roster. Following their debuts, Gekido remained undefeated inside Chikara ring, before Jigsaw submitted combatAnt in an eight-man tag team match on April 28.

Paragraph 36: Davies was director of rugby at Leeds Tykes from 1996 to 2006 before resigning his post. When he first took charge in 1996 Leeds where in National Division Four, where in his debut season the club finished third, two places above the previous season. In 1998, they were promoted up to the Allied Dunbar Premiership Two finishing in sixth place, before finishing runner-up to Rotherham in 1999–2000. In 2001, Davies lead Leeds to the National Division One title, losing just two games all season. They were therefore promoted to the top elite tournament for the 2001–02 English Premiership season. Despite winning six games during the season, and performed well in the 2001–02 European Challenge Cup, they finished bottom of the table, but avoided relegation due to the inadequacies of Rotherham's ground. In the 2002–03 English Premiership season, Davies led Leeds to fifth with 12 victories, and the second round of the 2002–03 European Challenge Cup. In 2004 Leeds finished 11th, but did however secure seven victories to place them 34 points clear of relegated team Rotherham. In their debut season of the Heineken Cup, Leeds gained a single victory, a 29–20 win over Neath-Swansea Ospreys. Davies left his post at Leeds after they were relegated at the end of the 2005–06 English Premiership season. Davies said at the time: "I have no immediate plans to go elsewhere, rather I just feel it's time to take a break. I want to make it clear this mutual decision has nothing to do with the current situation at Leeds. It is after much soul searching and discussion with my family and Leeds Tykes that I have decided to resign my post."

Paragraph 40: Although Trimble avoided the amputation of his wounded leg, his rehabilitation proceeded slowly. For months after, doctors periodically found bone fragments that had to be extracted. By November, he developed camp erysipelas and a probable case of osteomyelitis, and his ambitions for elevation to division command were on hold until he was well enough to return to active duty. He made his desire for promotion abundantly clear to his colleagues, and in one instance before the army moved north to Manassas, he was quoted as saying (probably humorously), "General Jackson, before this war is over, I intend to be a Major General or a corpse!" Jackson wrote a strong letter of recommendation, although he tempered it by including the sentence "I do not regard him as a good disciplinarian." Trimble engaged in a letterwriting campaign from his sick bed to obtain his promotion and to challenge Jackson's claim. He wrote to Adjutant General Samuel Cooper, "If I am to have promotion I want it at once and I particularly request, that my date may be from 26 August, the date of the capture of Manassas." (During this period Trimble also feuded with Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart about their conflicting reports of the battle and who bore primary responsibility for the seizure of the Union supply depot.)

Paragraph 43: Timothy Donohoo of CBR.com said, "America has been a part of predominantly critically well-received books, including the aforementioned Young Avengers and appearances in Kate Bishop's Hawkeye title. While she has had loud detractors, it bears repeating that she also rapidly amassed a relatively large and vocal fanbase. Her woes, in part, can be attributed to increased profile coinciding with a time when comics fans have increasingly dug in about "politics" in comics and a particular contingent reacting with venom to what they insist is "forced diversity." As a character, America's usually shown as a somewhat stony individual, being more observant than obnoxious and talkative. These qualities made her a strong figure within the Young Avengers, standing alongside the similarly star-spangled Patriot. Working alongside older heroes like Carol Danvers in the book The Ultimates, her admiration and respect for them was ironically seen as a legacy character done right. Her costume, much like Kamala Khan's, is also a great blend of stylish and superheroic, perfect for a modern multiversal Marvel heroine."
