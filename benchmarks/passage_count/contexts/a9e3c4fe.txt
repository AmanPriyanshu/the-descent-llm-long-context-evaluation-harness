Paragraph 1: It was in Turvey that Richmond began to write stories based on material he had collected while living in the Isle of Wight. These were simple tales about country folk. The Dairyman's Daughter was the first published, followed by The Young Cottager and The Negro Servant. All were originally published in the Christian Guardian between 1809 and 1814. The best known of his writings is The Dairyman's Daughter, of which as many as four millions in nineteen languages were circulated before 1849. A collected edition of his stories of village life was first published by the Religious Tract Society in 1814 under the title of Annals of the Poor. Sixteen years after Richmond's death, the engraver George Brannon published a supplement to Annals of the Poor under the title The Landscape Beauties of the Isle of Wight (1843).

Paragraph 2: In 1994, producers planned a major storyline that would revolve around a car crash; the biggest stunt to happen in the soaps first few years. The storyline was planned as an exit storyline for departing actors, Andrew Binns (Nurse Steve Mills) and Elizabeth Skeen (Sam's wife, TP). Naufahu was sceptical when he first heard TP was being killed off and recalled thinking, "her exit is gonna be pretty lame, she might choke on a KFC drumstick or something." The car crash was written to involve several characters, including Sam, Steve, TP, Chris Warner (Michael Galvin) and Kirsty Knight (Angela Dotchin), but it was not revealed to the public who would die. Whilst filming the stunt, paparazzi from a national newspaper arrived on location to try and capture which character would die, leading to weeks of speculation in the New Zealand entertainment media. Television New Zealand set about launching a disinformation campaign, with all the actors involved being interviewed for publications as though they were leaving the show. The storyline saw Chris, TP, Steve, and Kirsty travelling in a car back from Leonard (Marton Csokas) and Gina's (Josephine Davison) leaving party, only for Chris and Steve to get in a heated argument that saw the car roll off a bank. Sam arrived on scene, only to witness the car dramatically explode with TP and Steve still inside. The explosion was the final segment filmed in the scene, but Galvin noted the "Simple pleasures" they had in staying on location to witness the stunt. Naufahu found TP's death upsetting and admitted, "fogging up" whilst reading the final draft of the script, "TP was just so innocent and beautiful – the writers did amazingly. So then came the challenge of doing justice to the script." Naufahu believed the death of TP saw a huge change in Sam, "When TP passed away in a car crash I sort of realized I've actually got to really work and put something into it. That was a little bit of a turning point. It was a huge storyline." The death of TP weighed heavily on Sam for the rest of his first stint, his characterisation saw him become a "bitter" and "angry" man and eventually saw him depart in 1996 after realising he was had not coped properly with TP's death. In 2014, twenty years to the day of TP's death, scenes aired that saw Sam emotionally break down to Ula Levi (Frankie Adams) and admit how TP's death had impacted his life.

Paragraph 3: It's the 1940s, near the end of World War II in the American West. The setting is a large, fertile valley ideal for grazing cattle. Rancher Jacob W. Ewing's (Jason Robards) family has lived in the valley for generations, and his dream is to control all of it and preserve it from those - farmers and oilmen, for example - who would use the land for other purposes. Visiting J.W. is wealthy oil executive Neil Atkinson, whose late father was J.W.'s good friend and financial backer; the Atkinsons helped J.W. buy out neighboring ranchers, taking advantage of their financial problems (often with some "persuasion" from J.W.'s henchmen). The one remaining holdout is Ella Connors (Jane Fonda), whose family has ranched in the area for the last two generations and who relies on the family's aging but skillful cowhand Dodger (Richard Farnsworth). Another small player is war veteran Frank Athearn (James Caan) to whom Ella has sold a small plot of land to pay her bills. Ella and J.W. have some personal history which Ella prefers to put behind her, but which J.W. keeps bringing up. Although J.W. believes that Ella cannot survive another season financially, Ella and Frank, both of whom are committed to making a living ranching, enter into an uneasy alliance, especially after a dangerous incident precipitated by J.W. involving Frank and Frank's partner, fellow veteran Billy Joe Meynart (Mark Harmon). Neil, meanwhile, wants to explore the entire valley for oil, and uses his family's financial support to pressure J.W. into agreeing. Ella, Frank, and Neil soon discover that J.W. will go to any lengths to get what he wants.

Paragraph 6: Wrathchild was formed in 1978 by high school friends, Shannon Larkin, Kevin Keller, and Terry Carter. Keller met Carter after school in band class and was asked to join up with his friend Larkin. They had a band at the time named "Atlantis". Ralph "Rat" Tillman and Max "Tuck" McDonald soon joined and changed the name to Tyrant and then later to Wrathchild. Brad was recruited by Kevin Keller by throwing business cards at him while he was performing with his band "Ratzalad". John Turner was soon hired from his band "The Shift". Wrathchild was a renowned live act in the mid to late 1980s all across the U.S. when they were known simply as Wrathchild.  After years of touring, playing gigs, and hard work, the band finally was signed to a major label in 1988 thanks in large part to the dedicated work of Chip Seligman. However, a British glam metal band with the same name, Wrathchild, sued and forced the delay of the debut release. The band amended their name by adding America, and their debut album Climbin' the Walls peaked at No. 190 on the Billboard 200.  Their second album, 3-D (1991), coincided with the decline of the thrash metal scene and did not chart, although the album did spawn two music videos that received regular airplay on MTV's Headbangers Ball ("Spy" and "Surrounded By Idiots"). The band members had mud thrown at them for the filming of the Surrounded By Idiots video.  During its existence, the band toured or played selected shows with such bands as Slayer, Exodus, Testament, Annihilator, Pantera, Nuclear Assault, Armored Saint, Gang Green, Voivod, Vio-lence, Chris Poland and Dark Angel, among others. Around 1992, Wrathchild America was dropped from Atlantic Records and changed its name to Souls at Zero and revamped its style and approach.

Paragraph 7: The Philadelphia Inquirer gave a 3 out of 5 star rating, stating "And while there are no surprises here, the group offers another session of class music, fortified by strong melodies and appealing lyrics. The skilled blend of classic funk and mainstream values guarantees wide acceptance for this release. The groups shifts nicely from mellow ballads such as 'My Love' to upbeat material such as 'Let's Groove'." With a 7 out of 10 rating Fred Dellar of Smash Hits found that "White's production is impeccable; the vocals float and flare, the horns urge you onto the dance-floor and the rhythms make you stay there". Hugh Wyatt of the New York Daily News described the LP as "a real gem". With a 4 out of 5 stars rating Ken Tucker of Rolling Stone said "With each new album, Earth, Wind and Fire remain relatively true to their original sound: elaborate, neatly orchestral funk, influenced equally by American and African sources. But the band also keeps its ear to the radio. Accordingly, Raise! reflects the current wave of street-gritty black pop, from Lakeside to Rick James. Most of the tracks crank up the bass and feature rattling percussion that scrapes against the beat." Tucker added "On Raise!, White’s romanticism is slinkier, more seductive." With a four out of five stars rating Alan Coulthard of Record Mirror found that Raise! "sizzles from start to finish". People exclaimed EW&F's "New Age songs are ingenious sonic tapestries that blend tribal chants, zesty horns, brilliantly varied percussion, funky-flavored guitar rhythms and 2001-ish synthesizer sounds. Here an instrumental called Kalimba Tree melds into the LP's best cut, You Are a Winner, which has White's lead vocals bobbing and weaving with Philip Bailey's. The lyrics are mostly power-of-positive-thinking messages that might thrill Norman Vincent Peale but are no match for the music’s complexity." Richard Williams of The Times wrote "Paring away the overachievement of Faces, EW&F return to something like their best form".

Paragraph 8: Lord Ninian's campaign for election was based on reform of the poor law and extending the age range of the old age pension. He also stated of his desire of preserving and strengthening the military forces of Britain. He lost the election to Liberal candidate David Alfred Thomas in January 1910 but did manage to reduce the majority by half from the previous election in 1906. Despite his defeat, his popularity among voters was increasing and at the end of the election campaign a crowd of thousands of people came to see Crichton-Stuart and his wife travel to the train station. The crowd gathered outside the Angel Hotel where the couple were staying and, when they left, their carriage was pulled by around 60 volunteers. The procession stopped briefly outside Cardiff Conservative Club where Crichton-Stuart shook hands with numerous people and gave a short speech before continuing to the station. The Evening Express remarked on the procession, stating "never before has a parliamentary candidate, victorious or defeated, been so honoured by the people of Cardiff". On the polling day, Lord Ninian's son caught a chill being driven around Cardiff and later died. He was buried near Falkland Palace in Fife. Crichton-Stuart and his family did not permanently reside in Cardiff until he and his wife moved there in April 1910, moving into Penylan Court which had previously been the residence of William Tatem, 1st Baron Glanely. A second election was held in December 1910 following a hung parliament, in which Crichton-Stuart was successful, taking the seat from the Liberal candidate Clarendon Hyde, with a majority of 299 votes, a turnaround of 1,800 votes in the space of ten months. With a history in the military, the majority of the issues he raised before parliament concerned the armed forces, including the high costs officers were faced with during manoeuvres and a petition to improve the weaponry provided to the British cavalry units.

Paragraph 9: Barbara Hatch Rosenberg, a molecular biologist at the State University of New York at Purchase and chairwoman of a biological weapons panel at the Federation of American Scientists, and others began claiming that the attack might be the work of a "rogue CIA agent" in October 2001, as soon as it became known that the Ames strain of anthrax had been used in the attacks, and she told the FBI the name of the "most likely" person. On November 21, 2001, she made similar statements to the Biological and Toxic Weapons convention in Geneva. In December 2001, she published "A Compilation of Evidence and Comments on the Source of the Mailed Anthrax" via the web site of the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) claiming that the attacks were "perpetrated with the unwitting assistance of a sophisticated government program". She discussed the case with reporters from The New York Times. On January 4, 2002, Nicholas Kristof of The New York Times published a column titled "Profile of a Killer" stating "I think I know who sent out the anthrax last fall." For months, Rosenberg gave speeches and stated her beliefs to many reporters from around the world. She posted "Analysis of the Anthrax Attacks" to the FAS web site on January 17, 2002. On February 5, 2002, she published "Is the FBI Dragging Its Feet?" In response, the FBI stated, "There is no prime suspect in this case at this time". The Washington Post reported, "FBI officials over the last week have flatly discounted Dr. Rosenberg's claims". On June 13, 2002, Rosenberg posted "The Anthrax Case: What the FBI Knows" to the FAS site.  On June 18, 2002, she presented her theories to senate staffers working for Senators Daschle and Leahy. On June 25, the FBI publicly searched Steven Hatfill's apartment, and he became a household name. "The FBI also pointed out that Hatfill had agreed to the search and is not considered a suspect." American Prospect and Salon.com reported, "Hatfill is not a suspect in the anthrax case, the FBI says." On August 3, 2002, Rosenberg told the media that the FBI asked her if "a team of government scientists could be trying to frame Steven J. Hatfill". In August 2002, Attorney General John Ashcroft labeled Hatfill a "person of interest" in a press conference, though no charges were brought against him. Hatfill is a virologist, and he vehemently denied that he had anything to do with the anthrax mailings and sued the FBI, the Justice Department, Ashcroft, Alberto Gonzales, and others for violating his constitutional rights and for violating the Privacy Act. On June 27, 2008, the Department of Justice announced that it would settle Hatfill's case for $5.8 million.

Paragraph 11: Chandavarkar's most important recent work is his introduction (2004) to One Hundred Years, One Hundred Voices: The Millworkers of Girangaon, Neera Adarkar and Meena Menon’s wonderful oral history of the Girangaon neighbourhood in Mumbai. This long essay proved to be far more than an ordinary introduction; it was an original work of research and a sweeping history of the working class in the city from the 1880s to the 1980s that may long remain the standard work on the subject. The essay focused primarily on the transformations of working class allegiances over time, from the height of trade union and Communist activity to the Samyukta Maharashtra and Shiv Sena movements to the Great Strike of 1982. Drawing upon the accounts provided by Adarkar and Menon, it offered a multifaceted explanation for these developments that addressed the rich popular culture of Girangaon, the role of capitalists, the appeals and strategies of different political parties and leaderships, and the workers' own actions and interests.  The essay also highlighted the increasing political impotence of workers after 1982.   It is probably the work that best reflects the evolution of Chandavarkar's scholarship in recent years.  However, several other publications were still in process at the time of his death, including a Modern Asian Studies special issue on labour history he was editing (in which he will have an individual contribution on the decline of jobbers in Mumbai) and a long essay on colonialism and democracy. In recent years, he had become increasingly interested in the larger history of Mumbai. Less than twenty-four hours before his death, he gave a brilliant paper on the city from the seventeenth century to the present in the conference at Dartmouth. Other writing, unfortunately, was probably not so far along, and we fear that much of Chandavarkar's voluminous research in many different areas may now go unpublished.

Paragraph 13: Barrowman would prove never to become a regular squad member at St Andrew's. In January 2006 he signed for Walsall. He made his debut in a 5–0 defeat to Brentford, which proved to be the final act of manager Paul Merson's spell as manager. Barrowman gave away a penalty in this game with a "bizarre handball" with the score at 4–0. His fortunes improved the week after when he helped to rescue a point on his home debut against Scunthorpe United. With Walsall down to ten men, Barrowman latched onto a long ball and lobbed the goalkeeper to make it 2–2.

Paragraph 15: In 1991, Carell performed with Chicago troupe The Second City where Stephen Colbert was his understudy for a time. Carell made his film debut in a minor role in Curly Sue. In spring 1996 he was a cast member of The Dana Carvey Show, a short-lived sketch comedy program on ABC. Along with fellow cast member Colbert, Carell provided the voice of Gary, half of The Ambiguously Gay Duo, the Robert Smigel-produced animated short which continued on Saturday Night Live later that year. While the program lasted only seven episodes, The Dana Carvey Show has since been credited with forging Carell's career. He starred in a few short-lived television series, including Come to Papa and Over the Top. He has made numerous guest appearances, including in "Funny Girl," an episode of Just Shoot Me! Additional screen credits include Brad Hall's short-lived situation comedy Watching Ellie (20022003) and Woody Allen's Melinda and Melinda.

Paragraph 16: It's the 1940s, near the end of World War II in the American West. The setting is a large, fertile valley ideal for grazing cattle. Rancher Jacob W. Ewing's (Jason Robards) family has lived in the valley for generations, and his dream is to control all of it and preserve it from those - farmers and oilmen, for example - who would use the land for other purposes. Visiting J.W. is wealthy oil executive Neil Atkinson, whose late father was J.W.'s good friend and financial backer; the Atkinsons helped J.W. buy out neighboring ranchers, taking advantage of their financial problems (often with some "persuasion" from J.W.'s henchmen). The one remaining holdout is Ella Connors (Jane Fonda), whose family has ranched in the area for the last two generations and who relies on the family's aging but skillful cowhand Dodger (Richard Farnsworth).

Paragraph 17: It was in Turvey that Richmond began to write stories based on material he had collected while living in the Isle of Wight. These were simple tales about country folk. The Dairyman's Daughter was the first published, followed by The Young Cottager and The Negro Servant. All were originally published in the Christian Guardian between 1809 and 1814. The best known of his writings is The Dairyman's Daughter, of which as many as four millions in nineteen languages were circulated before 1849. A collected edition of his stories of village life was first published by the Religious Tract Society in 1814 under the title of Annals of the Poor. Sixteen years after Richmond's death, the engraver George Brannon published a supplement to Annals of the Poor under the title The Landscape Beauties of the Isle of Wight (1843).

The one remaining holdout is Ella Connors (Jane Fonda), whose family has ranched in the area for the last two generations and who relies on the family's aging but skillful cowhand Dodger (Richard Farnsworth). Another small player is war veteran Frank Athearn (James Caan) to whom Ella has sold a small plot of land to pay her bills. Ella and J.W. have some personal history which Ella prefers to put behind her, but which J.W. keeps bringing up. Although J.W. believes that Ella cannot survive another season financially, Ella and Frank, both of whom are committed to making a living ranching, enter into an uneasy alliance, especially after a dangerous incident precipitated by J.W. involving Frank and Frank's partner, fellow veteran Billy Joe Meynart (Mark Harmon). Neil, meanwhile, wants to explore the entire valley for oil, and uses his family's financial support to pressure J.W. into agreeing. Ella, Frank, and Neil soon discover that J.W. will go to any lengths to get what he wants.

Paragraph 21: The Philadelphia Inquirer gave a 3 out of 5 star rating, stating "And while there are no surprises here, the group offers another session of class music, fortified by strong melodies and appealing lyrics. The skilled blend of classic funk and mainstream values guarantees wide acceptance for this release. The groups shifts nicely from mellow ballads such as 'My Love' to upbeat material such as 'Let's Groove'." With a 7 out of 10 rating Fred Dellar of Smash Hits found that "White's production is impeccable; the vocals float and flare, the horns urge you onto the dance-floor and the rhythms make you stay there". Hugh Wyatt of the New York Daily News described the LP as "a real gem". With a 4 out of 5 stars rating Ken Tucker of Rolling Stone said "With each new album, Earth, Wind and Fire remain relatively true to their original sound: elaborate, neatly orchestral funk, influenced equally by American and African sources. But the band also keeps its ear to the radio. Accordingly, Raise! reflects the current wave of street-gritty black pop, from Lakeside to Rick James. Most of the tracks crank up the bass and feature rattling percussion that scrapes against the beat." Tucker added "On Raise!, White’s romanticism is slinkier, more seductive." With a four out of five stars rating Alan Coulthard of Record Mirror found that Raise! "sizzles from start to finish". People exclaimed EW&F's "New Age songs are ingenious sonic tapestries that blend tribal chants, zesty horns, brilliantly varied percussion, funky-flavored guitar rhythms and 2001-ish synthesizer sounds. Here an instrumental called Kalimba Tree melds into the LP's best cut, You Are a Winner, which has White's lead vocals bobbing and weaving with Philip Bailey's. The lyrics are mostly power-of-positive-thinking messages that might thrill Norman Vincent Peale but are no match for the music’s complexity." Richard Williams of The Times wrote "Paring away the overachievement of Faces, EW&F return to something like their best form".

Paragraph 22: Shamshi-Adad I inherited the throne in Ekallatum from Ila-kabkabu (fl. c. 1836 BC – c. 1833 BC). Ila-kabkabu is mentioned as the father of Shamshi-Adad I in the "Assyrian King List" (AKL); a similar name (not necessarily the same figure) is listed in the preceding section of the AKL among the “kings whose fathers are known”. However, Shamshi-Adad I did not inherit the Assyrian throne from his father but was instead a conqueror. Ila-kabkabu had been an Amorite king not of Assur (Aššur) (in Assyria) but of Ekallatum. According to the Mari Eponyms Chronicle, Ila-kabkabu seized Shuprum (c. 1790 BC), then Shamshi-Adad I “entered his father's house” (Shamshi-Adad I succeeded Ila-kabkabu as the king of Ekallatum, in the following year.):163 Šamši-Adad I had been forced to flee to Babylon (c. 1823 BC) while Narām-Sîn of Eshnunna (fl. c. 1850 BC – c. 1816 BC) had attacked Ekallatum. Shamshi-Adad I had remained in exile until the death of Naram-Sin of Eshnunna (c. 1816 BC.) The AKL records that Shamshi-Adad I "went away to Babylonia in the time of Naram-Sin". Shamshi-Adad I did not return until retaking Ekallatum, pausing for some time, and then overthrowing King Erishum II of Assur (fl. c. 1818 BC – c. 1809 BC)

Paragraph 24: It was in Turvey that Richmond began to write stories based on material he had collected while living in the Isle of Wight. These were simple tales about country folk. The Dairyman's Daughter was the first published, followed by The Young Cottager and The Negro Servant. All were originally published in the Christian Guardian between 1809 and 1814. The best known of his writings is The Dairyman's Daughter, of which as many as four millions in nineteen languages were circulated before 1849. A collected edition of his stories of village life was first published by the Religious Tract Society in 1814 under the title of Annals of the Poor. Sixteen years after Richmond's death, the engraver George Brannon published a supplement to Annals of the Poor under the title The Landscape Beauties of the Isle of Wight (1843).

Paragraph 25: Barbara Hatch Rosenberg, a molecular biologist at the State University of New York at Purchase and chairwoman of a biological weapons panel at the Federation of American Scientists, and others began claiming that the attack might be the work of a "rogue CIA agent" in October 2001, as soon as it became known that the Ames strain of anthrax had been used in the attacks, and she told the FBI the name of the "most likely" person. On November 21, 2001, she made similar statements to the Biological and Toxic Weapons convention in Geneva. In December 2001, she published "A Compilation of Evidence and Comments on the Source of the Mailed Anthrax" via the web site of the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) claiming that the attacks were "perpetrated with the unwitting assistance of a sophisticated government program". She discussed the case with reporters from The New York Times. On January 4, 2002, Nicholas Kristof of The New York Times published a column titled "Profile of a Killer" stating "I think I know who sent out the anthrax last fall." For months, Rosenberg gave speeches and stated her beliefs to many reporters from around the world. She posted "Analysis of the Anthrax Attacks" to the FAS web site on January 17, 2002. On February 5, 2002, she published "Is the FBI Dragging Its Feet?" In response, the FBI stated, "There is no prime suspect in this case at this time". The Washington Post reported, "FBI officials over the last week have flatly discounted Dr. Rosenberg's claims". On June 13, 2002, Rosenberg posted "The Anthrax Case: What the FBI Knows" to the FAS site.  On June 18, 2002, she presented her theories to senate staffers working for Senators Daschle and Leahy. On June 25, the FBI publicly searched Steven Hatfill's apartment, and he became a household name. "The FBI also pointed out that Hatfill had agreed to the search and is not considered a suspect." American Prospect and Salon.com reported, "Hatfill is not a suspect in the anthrax case, the FBI says." On August 3, 2002, Rosenberg told the media that the FBI asked her if "a team of government scientists could be trying to frame Steven J. Hatfill". In August 2002, Attorney General John Ashcroft labeled Hatfill a "person of interest" in a press conference, though no charges were brought against him. Hatfill is a virologist, and he vehemently denied that he had anything to do with the anthrax mailings and sued the FBI, the Justice Department, Ashcroft, Alberto Gonzales, and others for violating his constitutional rights and for violating the Privacy Act. On June 27, 2008, the Department of Justice announced that it would settle Hatfill's case for $5.8 million.

Paragraph 27: Wrathchild was formed in 1978 by high school friends, Shannon Larkin, Kevin Keller, and Terry Carter. Keller met Carter after school in band class and was asked to join up with his friend Larkin. They had a band at the time named "Atlantis". Ralph "Rat" Tillman and Max "Tuck" McDonald soon joined and changed the name to Tyrant and then later to Wrathchild. Brad was recruited by Kevin Keller by throwing business cards at him while he was performing with his band "Ratzalad". John Turner was soon hired from his band "The Shift". Wrathchild was a renowned live act in the mid to late 1980s all across the U.S. when they were known simply as Wrathchild.  After years of touring, playing gigs, and hard work, the band finally was signed to a major label in 1988 thanks in large part to the dedicated work of Chip Seligman. However, a British glam metal band with the same name, Wrathchild, sued and forced the delay of the debut release. The band amended their name by adding America, and their debut album Climbin' the Walls peaked at No. 190 on the Billboard 200.  Their second album, 3-D (1991), coincided with the decline of the thrash metal scene and did not chart, although the album did spawn two music videos that received regular airplay on MTV's Headbangers Ball ("Spy" and "Surrounded By Idiots"). The band members had mud thrown at them for the filming of the Surrounded By Idiots video.  During its existence, the band toured or played selected shows with such bands as Slayer, Exodus, Testament, Annihilator, Pantera, Nuclear Assault, Armored Saint, Gang Green, Voivod, Vio-lence, Chris Poland and Dark Angel, among others. Around 1992, Wrathchild America was dropped from Atlantic Records and changed its name to Souls at Zero and revamped its style and approach.

Paragraph 28: Maryland Route 45 (MD 45) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  Known for most of its length as York Road, the state highway runs  from U.S. Route 1 (US 1) and US 40 Truck in Baltimore north to the Pennsylvania state line in Maryland Line, where the highway continues as State Route 3001 (SR 3001).  MD 45 is the primary highway between Downtown Baltimore and Towson, the county seat of Baltimore County.  North of Interstate 695 (I-695), the state highway parallels I-83 and serves the suburban communities of Lutherville, Timonium, Cockeysville, and Hunt Valley.  MD 45 also connects the northern Baltimore County communities of Hereford and Parkton.  The state highway is maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration in Baltimore County and by the Baltimore City Department of Transportation in the city, where the highway also follows Greenmount Avenue.

Paragraph 31: "for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life, above and beyond the call of duty during an attack by about 170 heavily armed subversive terrorists at the Calapagan Patrol Base of the 433rd Philippine Constabulary Company Stationed at the Calampang, Lupon, Davao Oriental on 14 May 1985. It was near daybreak when heavily armed subversive terrorists, some carrying mortars and M-79 grenade launchers, stealthily surrounded the patrol base and upon reaching vantage positions simultaneously fired their weapons at the surprised troopers killing two sentinels on post during the initial burst of gunfire. Undaunted by the numerical and firepower superiority of the enemy, Master Sergeant Silvestre immediately deployed his handful of men, directing them to defend the base at all costs and ordering his radio operator to inform the Company Headquarters about the situation. As mortal shells and M-79 missiles rained on the base, accompanied by uninterrupted firing of the terrorists, 12 members of the base including Master Sergeant Silvestre were wounded. Disregarding multiple shrapnel wounds I his back and bullets blazing from all directions, he courageously crawled from foxhole ton foxhole, firing his M-16 rifle towards the enemy and shouting encouraging words to his men, urging them to fight decisively the terrorists who were gradually advancing and threatening to overrun the base. Although outnumbered 8 to 1, the beleaguered troops fought with intense ferocity, while their leader, with his exceptional marksmanship, fatally shot one by one the other terrorists as they crawled towards the patrol base. Although wounded, he accounted for six terrorists including Commander Mortar, the leader of the terrorists whom he shot in the forehead at the time when the subversive terrorist leader was calling on the troopers through a megaphone to surrender. Again he fell another terrorist who attempted to use the megaphone. With their leader dead, the enemy became demoralized. Fighting continued for another hour until the enemy finally withdrew through the nearby forested area, dragging some of their killed and wounded comrades. When the smoke of battle cleared, 21dead terrorists, two M-79s, two BARs, six M-16 rifles, ten U.S. Garand rifles, one megaphone, assorted empty magazines and subversive documents were recovered around the base perimeter. Thirty five other terrorists were confirmed later to have died during the fierce encounter. By this display of extraordinary gallantry, Master Sergeant Silvestre Jr contributed immeasurably towards the continued success of the campaign against subversive terrorism in the country, thereby distinguishing himself in the field of combat in keeping with the best traditions of Filipino soldiery."

Paragraph 32: It's the 1940s, near the end of World War II in the American West. The setting is a large, fertile valley ideal for grazing cattle. Rancher Jacob W. Ewing's (Jason Robards) family has lived in the valley for generations, and his dream is to control all of it and preserve it from those - farmers and oilmen, for example - who would use the land for other purposes. Visiting J.W. is wealthy oil executive Neil Atkinson, whose late father was J.W.'s good friend and financial backer; the Atkinsons helped J.W. buy out neighboring ranchers, taking advantage of their financial problems (often with some "persuasion" from J.W.'s henchmen). The one remaining holdout is Ella Connors (Jane Fonda), whose family has ranched in the area for the last two generations and who relies on the family's aging but skillful cowhand Dodger (Richard Farnsworth). Another small player is war veteran Frank Athearn (James Caan) to whom Ella has sold a small plot of land to pay her bills. Ella and J.W. have some personal history which Ella prefers to put behind her, but which J.W. keeps bringing up. Although J.W. believes that Ella cannot survive another season financially, Ella and Frank, both of whom are committed to making a living ranching, enter into an uneasy alliance, especially after a dangerous incident precipitated by J.W. involving Frank and Frank's partner, fellow veteran Billy Joe Meynart (Mark Harmon). Neil, meanwhile, wants to explore the entire valley for oil, and uses his family's financial support to pressure J.W. into agreeing.

Paragraph 33: Chandavarkar's most important recent work is his introduction (2004) to One Hundred Years, One Hundred Voices: The Millworkers of Girangaon, Neera Adarkar and Meena Menon’s wonderful oral history of the Girangaon neighbourhood in Mumbai. This long essay proved to be far more than an ordinary introduction; it was an original work of research and a sweeping history of the working class in the city from the 1880s to the 1980s that may long remain the standard work on the subject. The essay focused primarily on the transformations of working class allegiances over time, from the height of trade union and Communist activity to the Samyukta Maharashtra and Shiv Sena movements to the Great Strike of 1982. Drawing upon the accounts provided by Adarkar and Menon, it offered a multifaceted explanation for these developments that addressed the rich popular culture of Girangaon, the role of capitalists, the appeals and strategies of different political parties and leaderships, and the workers' own actions and interests.  The essay also highlighted the increasing political impotence of workers after 1982.   It is probably the work that best reflects the evolution of Chandavarkar's scholarship in recent years.  However, several other publications were still in process at the time of his death, including a Modern Asian Studies special issue on labour history he was editing (in which he will have an individual contribution on the decline of jobbers in Mumbai) and a long essay on colonialism and democracy. In recent years, he had become increasingly interested in the larger history of Mumbai. Less than twenty-four hours before his death, he gave a brilliant paper on the city from the seventeenth century to the present in the conference at Dartmouth. Other writing, unfortunately, was probably not so far along, and we fear that much of Chandavarkar's voluminous research in many different areas may now go unpublished.

Paragraph 34: Wrathchild was formed in 1978 by high school friends, Shannon Larkin, Kevin Keller, and Terry Carter. Keller met Carter after school in band class and was asked to join up with his friend Larkin. They had a band at the time named "Atlantis". Ralph "Rat" Tillman and Max "Tuck" McDonald soon joined and changed the name to Tyrant and then later to Wrathchild. Brad was recruited by Kevin Keller by throwing business cards at him while he was performing with his band "Ratzalad". John Turner was soon hired from his band "The Shift". Wrathchild was a renowned live act in the mid to late 1980s all across the U.S. when they were known simply as Wrathchild.  After years of touring, playing gigs, and hard work, the band finally was signed to a major label in 1988 thanks in large part to the dedicated work of Chip Seligman. However, a British glam metal band with the same name, Wrathchild, sued and forced the delay of the debut release. The band amended their name by adding America, and their debut album Climbin' the Walls peaked at No. 190 on the Billboard 200.  Their second album, 3-D (1991), coincided with the decline of the thrash metal scene and did not chart, although the album did spawn two music videos that received regular airplay on MTV's Headbangers Ball ("Spy" and "Surrounded By Idiots"). The band members had mud thrown at them for the filming of the Surrounded By Idiots video.  During its existence, the band toured or played selected shows with such bands as Slayer, Exodus, Testament, Annihilator, Pantera, Nuclear Assault, Armored Saint, Gang Green, Voivod, Vio-lence, Chris Poland and Dark Angel, among others. Around 1992, Wrathchild America was dropped from Atlantic Records and changed its name to Souls at Zero and revamped its style and approach.

Paragraph 36: "for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life, above and beyond the call of duty during an attack by about 170 heavily armed subversive terrorists at the Calapagan Patrol Base of the 433rd Philippine Constabulary Company Stationed at the Calampang, Lupon, Davao Oriental on 14 May 1985. It was near daybreak when heavily armed subversive terrorists, some carrying mortars and M-79 grenade launchers, stealthily surrounded the patrol base and upon reaching vantage positions simultaneously fired their weapons at the surprised troopers killing two sentinels on post during the initial burst of gunfire. Undaunted by the numerical and firepower superiority of the enemy, Master Sergeant Silvestre immediately deployed his handful of men, directing them to defend the base at all costs and ordering his radio operator to inform the Company Headquarters about the situation. As mortal shells and M-79 missiles rained on the base, accompanied by uninterrupted firing of the terrorists, 12 members of the base including Master Sergeant Silvestre were wounded. Disregarding multiple shrapnel wounds I his back and bullets blazing from all directions, he courageously crawled from foxhole ton foxhole, firing his M-16 rifle towards the enemy and shouting encouraging words to his men, urging them to fight decisively the terrorists who were gradually advancing and threatening to overrun the base. Although outnumbered 8 to 1, the beleaguered troops fought with intense ferocity, while their leader, with his exceptional marksmanship, fatally shot one by one the other terrorists as they crawled towards the patrol base. Although wounded, he accounted for six terrorists including Commander Mortar, the leader of the terrorists whom he shot in the forehead at the time when the subversive terrorist leader was calling on the troopers through a megaphone to surrender. Again he fell another terrorist who attempted to use the megaphone. With their leader dead, the enemy became demoralized. Fighting continued for another hour until the enemy finally withdrew through the nearby forested area, dragging some of their killed and wounded comrades. When the smoke of battle cleared, 21dead terrorists, two M-79s, two BARs, six M-16 rifles, ten U.S. Garand rifles, one megaphone, assorted empty magazines and subversive documents were recovered around the base perimeter. Thirty five other terrorists were confirmed later to have died during the fierce encounter. By this display of extraordinary gallantry, Master Sergeant Silvestre Jr contributed immeasurably towards the continued success of the campaign against subversive terrorism in the country, thereby distinguishing himself in the field of combat in keeping with the best traditions of Filipino soldiery."

Paragraph 37: Shamshi-Adad I inherited the throne in Ekallatum from Ila-kabkabu (fl. c. 1836 BC – c. 1833 BC). Ila-kabkabu is mentioned as the father of Shamshi-Adad I in the "Assyrian King List" (AKL); a similar name (not necessarily the same figure) is listed in the preceding section of the AKL among the “kings whose fathers are known”. However, Shamshi-Adad I did not inherit the Assyrian throne from his father but was instead a conqueror. Ila-kabkabu had been an Amorite king not of Assur (Aššur) (in Assyria) but of Ekallatum. According to the Mari Eponyms Chronicle, Ila-kabkabu seized Shuprum (c. 1790 BC), then Shamshi-Adad I “entered his father's house” (Shamshi-Adad I succeeded Ila-kabkabu as the king of Ekallatum, in the following year.):163 Šamši-Adad I had been forced to flee to Babylon (c. 1823 BC) while Narām-Sîn of Eshnunna (fl. c. 1850 BC – c. 1816 BC) had attacked Ekallatum. Shamshi-Adad I had remained in exile until the death of Naram-Sin of Eshnunna (c. 1816 BC.) The AKL records that Shamshi-Adad I "went away to Babylonia in the time of Naram-Sin". Shamshi-Adad I did not return until retaking Ekallatum, pausing for some time, and then overthrowing King Erishum II of Assur (fl. c. 1818 BC – c. 1809 BC)

Paragraph 38: Barrowman would prove never to become a regular squad member at St Andrew's. In January 2006 he signed for Walsall. He made his debut in a 5–0 defeat to Brentford, which proved to be the final act of manager Paul Merson's spell as manager. Barrowman gave away a penalty in this game with a "bizarre handball" with the score at 4–0. His fortunes improved the week after when he helped to rescue a point on his home debut against Scunthorpe United. With Walsall down to ten men, Barrowman latched onto a long ball and lobbed the goalkeeper to make it 2–2.

Paragraph 39: "for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life, above and beyond the call of duty during an attack by about 170 heavily armed subversive terrorists at the Calapagan Patrol Base of the 433rd Philippine Constabulary Company Stationed at the Calampang, Lupon, Davao Oriental on 14 May 1985.
