Paragraph 1: She was born in Siatista, Rumelia Eyalet, Ottoman Empire in 1860. Her brother Goulias Krakas was a rebel commander. When the 1878 Greek Macedonian rebellion began, she asked to join his forces, which he initially declined. One day, the Ottomans visited her to take her for interrogation, but she managed to escape dressed as a man, and went to find her brother in order to join his forces. There, she was initially treated with suspicion by her comrades, but she soon won their respect. The Ottomans managed to kill her brother; either by arresting and flaying him alive, or during a shootout between them and his group. Peristera (18 years old at the time) was then proclaimed unanimously as the new commander of the rebel group, which consisted of over 40 men, and became known as "Kapetan Spanovangelis". She fought valiantly in the broader region of Kozani and Kastoria for the next six months. She also located her brother's killers, and avenged his death. Her actions became known outside Greece, and the French newspaper Le Papillon called her, the Joan of Arc of the 19th century. She stopped her guerrilla activity and returned to Siatista when the Turks granted her amnesty; mediated by the Metropolitan of Sisanion and Siatista Agathangelos, who welcomed her in the church of Saint Demetrios. This amnesty was violated by the Turks, and Peristera was forced to leave Macedonia (which was still under Ottoman rule) and take refuge in Thessaly. She settled in Ampelonas, where she met with a comrade of hers, named Nikolaos Apostolou (or Perdikas). She married Apostolou in 1882, with whom she eventually had two daughters, named Anneta and Eleni. Apostolou was once arrested and imprisoned in Aegina; being accused of robbery. Peristera went to Athens and requested to meet with King George I, from whom she asked amnesty for her husband. According to tradition, she participated in a shooting match at the Shooting Range of Kaisariani, where she competed with the best shooters and won all of them. The King admired her shooting skills, and thus granted the requested amnesty. After 8 years of marriage, Apostolou was murdered in 1890. In the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, Peristera's house was burned down by the Turks. Around 1898, Peristera was married for a second time, to someone named Papagianopoulos; with whom she had one son, named Charilaos. Her second husband also died in 1902. Peristera lived the rest of her life in Ampelonas; devoted to raising her children. She died in 1938. In 1990, a statue was raised in her honor, at her native town of Siatista.

Paragraph 3: Following the deployment of the 1437th in support of the initial invasion force in 2003, the 1431st and 1430th engineer companies were deployed to Iraq in 2004, battalion headquarters deployed in 2007, 1437th engineer company deployed elements to Iraq in 2009. The battalion then rotated deployments into Afghanistan as the Iraq War came to an end. The 1431st Engineer Company was re-classified as a combat engineer (Sapper) company and was activated to deploy to Afghanistan in November 2008 to conduct Route Clearance patrols. The unit was under the command of the 168th Engineer Brigade while deployed, which itself was under the command of the 101st Airborne Division, in February 2009 4th Brigade Combat Team (Airborne), 25th Infantry Division relieved the 101st, placing all units in the region under its command. Many of the Iraq veterans from the unit's first deployment returned for the next deployment. The unit was stationed at FOB Salerno near Khost Afghanistan with one detachment stationed in Paktika Province. This location in Eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistani border proved to be a challenge as the unit had to clear the notorious Khost-Gardez Pass as a routine part of its operation. This resulted in regular ambushes and firefights, moreover both FOB Salerno and Orgun-E were regularly shelled by insurgent mortar and rocket fire, many of the returning soldiers of the 1431st engineer company were injured while in combat. Several soldiers of the 1431st Engineer company had to be evacuated out of Afghanistan due to severity of their injuries during the deployment.  Some of the experiences of the unit were documented in the PBS film Where Soldiers Come From, which was made by a reporter embedded with the unit and received and Emmy Award for Outstanding Continuing Coverage of a News Story. Although the unit engaged in heavy combat while deployed and many of the soldiers suffered serious injuries the unit did not lose any men. As a tribute to this all combat medics of the unit, specialists Alaniz, Avramenko, Oosterbaan, and Zelinski, were awarded the Combat Medic Badge for their service in the conflict. Through the deployment the unit also engaged in missions outside of Route Clearance such as collecting biographical data on the local population and guarding detainees. As Route Clearance units were not part of ISAF forces at the time the unit's rules of engagement allowed for the 2 day detention of any suspicious personnel.

Paragraph 4: Catholic Central High School, named after the high school of the same name in Detroit, Michigan, was opened in September 1950 in what had been the Sacred Heart Convent. It consisted of grades XI, XII and XII. The Sisters of St. Joseph taught the girls and the commercial classes and the Christian Brothers taught the boys in the general classes under associate principalships held by Sr. Mary Angela and Brother Stanislaus respectively. By January 5, 1951, the Catholic Central sports teams had adopted the name Crusaders. The girls were known as Crusaderettes. It was about the autumn of 1952 that the words to the "Crusader Song" were composed by Barry McIlhargey, a grade XII student and football player. Meanwhile, the cornerstone for Sacred Heart Separate School, to the immediate west of Catholic Central High School was laid on December 8, 1951. By the time the school was officially opened on September 14, 1952, the school's name had been changed to Catholic Central Separate School (CCSS) and consisted of grades VII, VIII, IX and X. Sr. Elaine Dunn was its first principal. With the opening of CCSS, St. Angela's College, De La Salle High School and Sacred Heart Commercial closed their doors and their pupils were now absorbed into Catholic Central Separate School. The Christian Brothers also left London and Fr. Joe Finn, a diocesan priest, took Brother Stanislaus' place as associate principal. Father Dominic A. Kirwan, C.R. succeeded Fr. Finn in September 1952. In the fall of 1958 the construction of a new building for Catholic Central High School (CCHS) was begun to the west of Catholic Central Separate School. It opened for its first students in September 1959. In September 1963, CCHS was placed under the principalship of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate with Fr. Harold Conway as principal. The Board had first attempted to entice the Basilans to taken over the running of the school but the latter declined. In 1967, CCHS and Catholic Central Separate School, which for a number of years held only grade IX and X students, were joined under one principalship, with Fr. Conway as the first principle for grades IX-XIII A "tunnel" which was half above ground, was constructed to physically unite the two structures, which became known as the East Wing and the West Wing  Owing to an increase in student population, a total of 14 portables were added between 1970 and 1972.  The north wing which accommodates the Fine Arts & Family Studies programs was constructed in 1986.

Paragraph 9: There are two types of violation that can be caused by clock skew. One problem is caused when the clock reaches the first register and the clock signal towards the second register travels slower than output of the first register into the second register  - the output of the first register reaches the second register input faster and therefore is clocked replacing the initial data on the second register, or maybe destroying the integrity of the latched data. This is called a hold violation because the previous data is not held long enough at the destination flip-flop to be properly clocked through. Another problem is caused if the destination flip-flop receives the clock tick earlier than the source flip-flop - the data signal has that much less time to reach the destination flip-flop before the next clock tick. If it fails to do so, a setup violation occurs, so-called because the new data was not set up and stable before the next clock tick arrived. A hold violation is more serious than a setup violation because it cannot be fixed by increasing the clock period. Positive skew and negative skew cannot negatively impact setup and hold timing constraints respectively (see inequalities below).

Paragraph 10: The tornado then reached low-end EF3 intensity as it exited Laurel and crossed Interstate 59, snapping and uprooting numerous trees, and toppling several large metal truss transmission towers to the ground. Low-end EF3 damage continued as the tornado then completely destroyed the Wade Services manufacturing plant, along with several other metal buildings and an office building on the property. Northeast of this area, the tornado momentarily weakened and caused EF1 tree damage as it moved along the east side of Interstate 59. The tornado became strong again as it then impacted the southern fringes of Sandersville at EF2 strength, where a house sustained loss of much of its roof, along with some second floor exterior walls. Another home sustained major roof damage, outbuildings were damaged or destroyed, numerous large trees were snapped or uprooted, and two people sustained minor injuries in the Sandersville area. Past Sandersville, the tornado weakened back to EF1 strength as it struck the Mississippi Choctaw Reservation, where homes sustained roof and garage damage, a small pavilion collapsed, trees were downed, and headstones were tipped over at a cemetery. EF0 and EF1 damage to trees and homes continued through the extreme northwestern corner of Wayne County and into the southwestern corner of Clarke County, though a small pocket of EF2 damage occurred along County Road 223, where numerous large trees were snapped and a mobile home was rolled and destroyed. Additional EF2 damage occurred as the tornado crossed US 45 north of Shubuta, where a well-built home had most if its roof torn off. Northeast of Shubuta, numerous trees were snapped and uprooted at EF1 strength as the tornado moved through rural areas. A few outbuildings and mobile homes were damaged as well. A final area of EF2 damage occurred to the southwest of the small community of Mannassa, where a well-built home along County Road 664 sustained destruction of its attached garage, and had a large portion of its roof torn off. A nearby mobile home was rolled and destroyed as well. Northeast of Mannassa, the tornado weakened to EF0 strength as it approached the Alabama border, causing only tree limb damage in rural areas. The tornado then regained EF1 strength as it crossed into Choctaw County, Alabama, downing trees and destroying a mobile home. Additional trees were snapped or uprooted, and a house sustained partial removal of its roof before the tornado dissipated to the west-northwest of Lisman, Alabama after traveling .

The 1431st Engineer Company was re-classified as a combat engineer (Sapper) company and was activated to deploy to Afghanistan in November 2008 to conduct Route Clearance patrols. The unit was under the command of the 168th Engineer Brigade while deployed, which itself was under the command of the 101st Airborne Division, in February 2009 4th Brigade Combat Team (Airborne), 25th Infantry Division relieved the 101st, placing all units in the region under its command. Many of the Iraq veterans from the unit's first deployment returned for the next deployment. The unit was stationed at FOB Salerno near Khost Afghanistan with one detachment stationed in Paktika Province. This location in Eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistani border proved to be a challenge as the unit had to clear the notorious Khost-Gardez Pass as a routine part of its operation. This resulted in regular ambushes and firefights, moreover both FOB Salerno and Orgun-E were regularly shelled by insurgent mortar and rocket fire, many of the returning soldiers of the 1431st engineer company were injured while in combat. Several soldiers of the 1431st Engineer company had to be evacuated out of Afghanistan due to severity of their injuries during the deployment.  Some of the experiences of the unit were documented in the PBS film Where Soldiers Come From, which was made by a reporter embedded with the unit and received and Emmy Award for Outstanding Continuing Coverage of a News Story. Although the unit engaged in heavy combat while deployed and many of the soldiers suffered serious injuries the unit did not lose any men. As a tribute to this all combat medics of the unit, specialists Alaniz, Avramenko, Oosterbaan, and Zelinski, were awarded the Combat Medic Badge for their service in the conflict. Through the deployment the unit also engaged in missions outside of Route Clearance such as collecting biographical data on the local population and guarding detainees. As Route Clearance units were not part of ISAF forces at the time the unit's rules of engagement allowed for the 2 day detention of any suspicious personnel.

Paragraph 16: The tornado then reached low-end EF3 intensity as it exited Laurel and crossed Interstate 59, snapping and uprooting numerous trees, and toppling several large metal truss transmission towers to the ground. Low-end EF3 damage continued as the tornado then completely destroyed the Wade Services manufacturing plant, along with several other metal buildings and an office building on the property. Northeast of this area, the tornado momentarily weakened and caused EF1 tree damage as it moved along the east side of Interstate 59. The tornado became strong again as it then impacted the southern fringes of Sandersville at EF2 strength, where a house sustained loss of much of its roof, along with some second floor exterior walls. Another home sustained major roof damage, outbuildings were damaged or destroyed, numerous large trees were snapped or uprooted, and two people sustained minor injuries in the Sandersville area. Past Sandersville, the tornado weakened back to EF1 strength as it struck the Mississippi Choctaw Reservation, where homes sustained roof and garage damage, a small pavilion collapsed, trees were downed, and headstones were tipped over at a cemetery. EF0 and EF1 damage to trees and homes continued through the extreme northwestern corner of Wayne County and into the southwestern corner of Clarke County, though a small pocket of EF2 damage occurred along County Road 223, where numerous large trees were snapped and a mobile home was rolled and destroyed. Additional EF2 damage occurred as the tornado crossed US 45 north of Shubuta, where a well-built home had most if its roof torn off. Northeast of Shubuta, numerous trees were snapped and uprooted at EF1 strength as the tornado moved through rural areas. A few outbuildings and mobile homes were damaged as well. A final area of EF2 damage occurred to the southwest of the small community of Mannassa, where a well-built home along County Road 664 sustained destruction of its attached garage, and had a large portion of its roof torn off. A nearby mobile home was rolled and destroyed as well. Northeast of Mannassa, the tornado weakened to EF0 strength as it approached the Alabama border, causing only tree limb damage in rural areas. The tornado then regained EF1 strength as it crossed into Choctaw County, Alabama, downing trees and destroying a mobile home. Additional trees were snapped or uprooted, and a house sustained partial removal of its roof before the tornado dissipated to the west-northwest of Lisman, Alabama after traveling .

Paragraph 17: There are two types of violation that can be caused by clock skew. One problem is caused when the clock reaches the first register and the clock signal towards the second register travels slower than output of the first register into the second register  - the output of the first register reaches the second register input faster and therefore is clocked replacing the initial data on the second register, or maybe destroying the integrity of the latched data. This is called a hold violation because the previous data is not held long enough at the destination flip-flop to be properly clocked through. Another problem is caused if the destination flip-flop receives the clock tick earlier than the source flip-flop - the data signal has that much less time to reach the destination flip-flop before the next clock tick. If it fails to do so, a setup violation occurs, so-called because the new data was not set up and stable before the next clock tick arrived. A hold violation is more serious than a setup violation because it cannot be fixed by increasing the clock period. Positive skew and negative skew cannot negatively impact setup and hold timing constraints respectively (see inequalities below).

Paragraph 18: She was born in Siatista, Rumelia Eyalet, Ottoman Empire in 1860. Her brother Goulias Krakas was a rebel commander. When the 1878 Greek Macedonian rebellion began, she asked to join his forces, which he initially declined. One day, the Ottomans visited her to take her for interrogation, but she managed to escape dressed as a man, and went to find her brother in order to join his forces. There, she was initially treated with suspicion by her comrades, but she soon won their respect. The Ottomans managed to kill her brother; either by arresting and flaying him alive, or during a shootout between them and his group. Peristera (18 years old at the time) was then proclaimed unanimously as the new commander of the rebel group, which consisted of over 40 men, and became known as "Kapetan Spanovangelis". She fought valiantly in the broader region of Kozani and Kastoria for the next six months. She also located her brother's killers, and avenged his death. Her actions became known outside Greece, and the French newspaper Le Papillon called her, the Joan of Arc of the 19th century. She stopped her guerrilla activity and returned to Siatista when the Turks granted her amnesty; mediated by the Metropolitan of Sisanion and Siatista Agathangelos, who welcomed her in the church of Saint Demetrios. This amnesty was violated by the Turks, and Peristera was forced to leave Macedonia (which was still under Ottoman rule) and take refuge in Thessaly. She settled in Ampelonas, where she met with a comrade of hers, named Nikolaos Apostolou (or Perdikas). She married Apostolou in 1882, with whom she eventually had two daughters, named Anneta and Eleni. Apostolou was once arrested and imprisoned in Aegina; being accused of robbery. Peristera went to Athens and requested to meet with King George I, from whom she asked amnesty for her husband. According to tradition, she participated in a shooting match at the Shooting Range of Kaisariani, where she competed with the best shooters and won all of them. The King admired her shooting skills, and thus granted the requested amnesty. After 8 years of marriage, Apostolou was murdered in 1890. In the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, Peristera's house was burned down by the Turks. Around 1898, Peristera was married for a second time, to someone named Papagianopoulos; with whom she had one son, named Charilaos. Her second husband also died in 1902. Peristera lived the rest of her life in Ampelonas; devoted to raising her children. She died in 1938. In 1990, a statue was raised in her honor, at her native town of Siatista.

Paragraph 20: Catholic Central High School, named after the high school of the same name in Detroit, Michigan, was opened in September 1950 in what had been the Sacred Heart Convent. It consisted of grades XI, XII and XII. The Sisters of St. Joseph taught the girls and the commercial classes and the Christian Brothers taught the boys in the general classes under associate principalships held by Sr. Mary Angela and Brother Stanislaus respectively. By January 5, 1951, the Catholic Central sports teams had adopted the name Crusaders. The girls were known as Crusaderettes. It was about the autumn of 1952 that the words to the "Crusader Song" were composed by Barry McIlhargey, a grade XII student and football player. Meanwhile, the cornerstone for Sacred Heart Separate School, to the immediate west of Catholic Central High School was laid on December 8, 1951. By the time the school was officially opened on September 14, 1952, the school's name had been changed to Catholic Central Separate School (CCSS) and consisted of grades VII, VIII, IX and X. Sr. Elaine Dunn was its first principal. With the opening of CCSS, St. Angela's College, De La Salle High School and Sacred Heart Commercial closed their doors and their pupils were now absorbed into Catholic Central Separate School. The Christian Brothers also left London and Fr. Joe Finn, a diocesan priest, took Brother Stanislaus' place as associate principal. Father Dominic A. Kirwan, C.R. succeeded Fr. Finn in September 1952. In the fall of 1958 the construction of a new building for Catholic Central High School (CCHS) was begun to the west of Catholic Central Separate School. It opened for its first students in September 1959. In September 1963, CCHS was placed under the principalship of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate with Fr. Harold Conway as principal. The Board had first attempted to entice the Basilans to taken over the running of the school but the latter declined. In 1967, CCHS and Catholic Central Separate School, which for a number of years held only grade IX and X students, were joined under one principalship, with Fr. Conway as the first principle for grades IX-XIII A "tunnel" which was half above ground, was constructed to physically unite the two structures, which became known as the East Wing and the West Wing  Owing to an increase in student population, a total of 14 portables were added between 1970 and 1972.  The north wing which accommodates the Fine Arts & Family Studies programs was constructed in 1986.

With the opening of CCSS, St. Angela's College, De La Salle High School and Sacred Heart Commercial closed their doors and their pupils were now absorbed into Catholic Central Separate School. The Christian Brothers also left London and Fr. Joe Finn, a diocesan priest, took Brother Stanislaus' place as associate principal. Father Dominic A. Kirwan, C.R. succeeded Fr. Finn in September 1952. In the fall of 1958 the construction of a new building for Catholic Central High School (CCHS) was begun to the west of Catholic Central Separate School. It opened for its first students in September 1959. In September 1963, CCHS was placed under the principalship of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate with Fr. Harold Conway as principal. The Board had first attempted to entice the Basilans to taken over the running of the school but the latter declined. In 1967, CCHS and Catholic Central Separate School, which for a number of years held only grade IX and X students, were joined under one principalship, with Fr. Conway as the first principle for grades IX-XIII A "tunnel" which was half above ground, was constructed to physically unite the two structures, which became known as the East Wing and the West Wing  Owing to an increase in student population, a total of 14 portables were added between 1970 and 1972.  The north wing which accommodates the Fine Arts & Family Studies programs was constructed in 1986.

Paragraph 30: Following the deployment of the 1437th in support of the initial invasion force in 2003, the 1431st and 1430th engineer companies were deployed to Iraq in 2004, battalion headquarters deployed in 2007, 1437th engineer company deployed elements to Iraq in 2009. The battalion then rotated deployments into Afghanistan as the Iraq War came to an end. The 1431st Engineer Company was re-classified as a combat engineer (Sapper) company and was activated to deploy to Afghanistan in November 2008 to conduct Route Clearance patrols. The unit was under the command of the 168th Engineer Brigade while deployed, which itself was under the command of the 101st Airborne Division, in February 2009 4th Brigade Combat Team (Airborne), 25th Infantry Division relieved the 101st, placing all units in the region under its command. Many of the Iraq veterans from the unit's first deployment returned for the next deployment. The unit was stationed at FOB Salerno near Khost Afghanistan with one detachment stationed in Paktika Province. This location in Eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistani border proved to be a challenge as the unit had to clear the notorious Khost-Gardez Pass as a routine part of its operation. This resulted in regular ambushes and firefights, moreover both FOB Salerno and Orgun-E were regularly shelled by insurgent mortar and rocket fire, many of the returning soldiers of the 1431st engineer company were injured while in combat. Several soldiers of the 1431st Engineer company had to be evacuated out of Afghanistan due to severity of their injuries during the deployment.  Some of the experiences of the unit were documented in the PBS film Where Soldiers Come From, which was made by a reporter embedded with the unit and received and Emmy Award for Outstanding Continuing Coverage of a News Story. Although the unit engaged in heavy combat while deployed and many of the soldiers suffered serious injuries the unit did not lose any men. As a tribute to this all combat medics of the unit, specialists Alaniz, Avramenko, Oosterbaan, and Zelinski, were awarded the Combat Medic Badge for their service in the conflict. Through the deployment the unit also engaged in missions outside of Route Clearance such as collecting biographical data on the local population and guarding detainees. As Route Clearance units were not part of ISAF forces at the time the unit's rules of engagement allowed for the 2 day detention of any suspicious personnel.

Paragraph 31: She was born in Siatista, Rumelia Eyalet, Ottoman Empire in 1860. Her brother Goulias Krakas was a rebel commander. When the 1878 Greek Macedonian rebellion began, she asked to join his forces, which he initially declined. One day, the Ottomans visited her to take her for interrogation, but she managed to escape dressed as a man, and went to find her brother in order to join his forces. There, she was initially treated with suspicion by her comrades, but she soon won their respect. The Ottomans managed to kill her brother; either by arresting and flaying him alive, or during a shootout between them and his group. Peristera (18 years old at the time) was then proclaimed unanimously as the new commander of the rebel group, which consisted of over 40 men, and became known as "Kapetan Spanovangelis". She fought valiantly in the broader region of Kozani and Kastoria for the next six months. She also located her brother's killers, and avenged his death. Her actions became known outside Greece, and the French newspaper Le Papillon called her, the Joan of Arc of the 19th century. She stopped her guerrilla activity and returned to Siatista when the Turks granted her amnesty; mediated by the Metropolitan of Sisanion and Siatista Agathangelos, who welcomed her in the church of Saint Demetrios. This amnesty was violated by the Turks, and Peristera was forced to leave Macedonia (which was still under Ottoman rule) and take refuge in Thessaly. She settled in Ampelonas, where she met with a comrade of hers, named Nikolaos Apostolou (or Perdikas). She married Apostolou in 1882, with whom she eventually had two daughters, named Anneta and Eleni. Apostolou was once arrested and imprisoned in Aegina; being accused of robbery. Peristera went to Athens and requested to meet with King George I, from whom she asked amnesty for her husband. According to tradition, she participated in a shooting match at the Shooting Range of Kaisariani, where she competed with the best shooters and won all of them. The King admired her shooting skills, and thus granted the requested amnesty. After 8 years of marriage, Apostolou was murdered in 1890. In the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, Peristera's house was burned down by the Turks. Around 1898, Peristera was married for a second time, to someone named Papagianopoulos; with whom she had one son, named Charilaos. Her second husband also died in 1902. Peristera lived the rest of her life in Ampelonas; devoted to raising her children. She died in 1938. In 1990, a statue was raised in her honor, at her native town of Siatista.

Paragraph 34: Catholic Central High School, named after the high school of the same name in Detroit, Michigan, was opened in September 1950 in what had been the Sacred Heart Convent. It consisted of grades XI, XII and XII. The Sisters of St. Joseph taught the girls and the commercial classes and the Christian Brothers taught the boys in the general classes under associate principalships held by Sr. Mary Angela and Brother Stanislaus respectively. By January 5, 1951, the Catholic Central sports teams had adopted the name Crusaders. The girls were known as Crusaderettes. It was about the autumn of 1952 that the words to the "Crusader Song" were composed by Barry McIlhargey, a grade XII student and football player. Meanwhile, the cornerstone for Sacred Heart Separate School, to the immediate west of Catholic Central High School was laid on December 8, 1951.

Paragraph 35: The tornado then reached low-end EF3 intensity as it exited Laurel and crossed Interstate 59, snapping and uprooting numerous trees, and toppling several large metal truss transmission towers to the ground. Low-end EF3 damage continued as the tornado then completely destroyed the Wade Services manufacturing plant, along with several other metal buildings and an office building on the property. Northeast of this area, the tornado momentarily weakened and caused EF1 tree damage as it moved along the east side of Interstate 59. The tornado became strong again as it then impacted the southern fringes of Sandersville at EF2 strength, where a house sustained loss of much of its roof, along with some second floor exterior walls. Another home sustained major roof damage, outbuildings were damaged or destroyed, numerous large trees were snapped or uprooted, and two people sustained minor injuries in the Sandersville area. Past Sandersville, the tornado weakened back to EF1 strength as it struck the Mississippi Choctaw Reservation, where homes sustained roof and garage damage, a small pavilion collapsed, trees were downed, and headstones were tipped over at a cemetery. EF0 and EF1 damage to trees and homes continued through the extreme northwestern corner of Wayne County and into the southwestern corner of Clarke County, though a small pocket of EF2 damage occurred along County Road 223, where numerous large trees were snapped and a mobile home was rolled and destroyed. Additional EF2 damage occurred as the tornado crossed US 45 north of Shubuta, where a well-built home had most if its roof torn off. Northeast of Shubuta, numerous trees were snapped and uprooted at EF1 strength as the tornado moved through rural areas. A few outbuildings and mobile homes were damaged as well. A final area of EF2 damage occurred to the southwest of the small community of Mannassa, where a well-built home along County Road 664 sustained destruction of its attached garage, and had a large portion of its roof torn off. A nearby mobile home was rolled and destroyed as well. Northeast of Mannassa, the tornado weakened to EF0 strength as it approached the Alabama border, causing only tree limb damage in rural areas. The tornado then regained EF1 strength as it crossed into Choctaw County, Alabama, downing trees and destroying a mobile home. Additional trees were snapped or uprooted, and a house sustained partial removal of its roof before the tornado dissipated to the west-northwest of Lisman, Alabama after traveling .

Paragraph 39: There are two types of violation that can be caused by clock skew. One problem is caused when the clock reaches the first register and the clock signal towards the second register travels slower than output of the first register into the second register  - the output of the first register reaches the second register input faster and therefore is clocked replacing the initial data on the second register, or maybe destroying the integrity of the latched data. This is called a hold violation because the previous data is not held long enough at the destination flip-flop to be properly clocked through. Another problem is caused if the destination flip-flop receives the clock tick earlier than the source flip-flop - the data signal has that much less time to reach the destination flip-flop before the next clock tick. If it fails to do so, a setup violation occurs, so-called because the new data was not set up and stable before the next clock tick arrived. A hold violation is more serious than a setup violation because it cannot be fixed by increasing the clock period. Positive skew and negative skew cannot negatively impact setup and hold timing constraints respectively (see inequalities below).

The unit was stationed at FOB Salerno near Khost Afghanistan with one detachment stationed in Paktika Province. This location in Eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistani border proved to be a challenge as the unit had to clear the notorious Khost-Gardez Pass as a routine part of its operation. This resulted in regular ambushes and firefights, moreover both FOB Salerno and Orgun-E were regularly shelled by insurgent mortar and rocket fire, many of the returning soldiers of the 1431st engineer company were injured while in combat. Several soldiers of the 1431st Engineer company had to be evacuated out of Afghanistan due to severity of their injuries during the deployment.  Some of the experiences of the unit were documented in the PBS film Where Soldiers Come From, which was made by a reporter embedded with the unit and received and Emmy Award for Outstanding Continuing Coverage of a News Story. Although the unit engaged in heavy combat while deployed and many of the soldiers suffered serious injuries the unit did not lose any men. As a tribute to this all combat medics of the unit, specialists Alaniz, Avramenko, Oosterbaan, and Zelinski, were awarded the Combat Medic Badge for their service in the conflict. Through the deployment the unit also engaged in missions outside of Route Clearance such as collecting biographical data on the local population and guarding detainees. As Route Clearance units were not part of ISAF forces at the time the unit's rules of engagement allowed for the 2 day detention of any suspicious personnel.

Paragraph 45: Catholic Central High School, named after the high school of the same name in Detroit, Michigan, was opened in September 1950 in what had been the Sacred Heart Convent. It consisted of grades XI, XII and XII. The Sisters of St. Joseph taught the girls and the commercial classes and the Christian Brothers taught the boys in the general classes under associate principalships held by Sr. Mary Angela and Brother Stanislaus respectively. By January 5, 1951, the Catholic Central sports teams had adopted the name Crusaders. The girls were known as Crusaderettes. It was about the autumn of 1952 that the words to the "Crusader Song" were composed by Barry McIlhargey, a grade XII student and football player. Meanwhile, the cornerstone for Sacred Heart Separate School, to the immediate west of Catholic Central High School was laid on December 8, 1951. By the time the school was officially opened on September 14, 1952, the school's name had been changed to Catholic Central Separate School (CCSS) and consisted of grades VII, VIII, IX and X. Sr. Elaine Dunn was its first principal. With the opening of CCSS, St. Angela's College, De La Salle High School and Sacred Heart Commercial closed their doors and their pupils were now absorbed into Catholic Central Separate School. The Christian Brothers also left London and Fr. Joe Finn, a diocesan priest, took Brother Stanislaus' place as associate principal. Father Dominic A. Kirwan, C.R. succeeded Fr. Finn in September 1952. In the fall of 1958 the construction of a new building for Catholic Central High School (CCHS) was begun to the west of Catholic Central Separate School. It opened for its first students in September 1959. In September 1963, CCHS was placed under the principalship of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate with Fr. Harold Conway as principal. The Board had first attempted to entice the Basilans to taken over the running of the school but the latter declined. In 1967, CCHS and Catholic Central Separate School, which for a number of years held only grade IX and X students, were joined under one principalship, with Fr. Conway as the first principle for grades IX-XIII A "tunnel" which was half above ground, was constructed to physically unite the two structures, which became known as the East Wing and the West Wing  Owing to an increase in student population, a total of 14 portables were added between 1970 and 1972.  The north wing which accommodates the Fine Arts & Family Studies programs was constructed in 1986.

Paragraph 46: There are two types of violation that can be caused by clock skew. One problem is caused when the clock reaches the first register and the clock signal towards the second register travels slower than output of the first register into the second register  - the output of the first register reaches the second register input faster and therefore is clocked replacing the initial data on the second register, or maybe destroying the integrity of the latched data. This is called a hold violation because the previous data is not held long enough at the destination flip-flop to be properly clocked through. Another problem is caused if the destination flip-flop receives the clock tick earlier than the source flip-flop - the data signal has that much less time to reach the destination flip-flop before the next clock tick. If it fails to do so, a setup violation occurs, so-called because the new data was not set up and stable before the next clock tick arrived. A hold violation is more serious than a setup violation because it cannot be fixed by increasing the clock period. Positive skew and negative skew cannot negatively impact setup and hold timing constraints respectively (see inequalities below).
