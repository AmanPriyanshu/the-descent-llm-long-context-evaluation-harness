Project Manager: Okay . So welcome back .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: What do {gap} {disfmarker} do we have to do ? {vocalsound}
Marketing: {gap} .
Project Manager: So first . I want to say I'm the secretary , so I make the minutes . You find them in your {disfmarker} in the map in the From the group . There's the minutes from the first meeting . You'll find the next minutes also there . Then {vocalsound} I wanna hear from you , what you've done . And after that I have some new product requirements . So {disfmarker} And after that we have to make decisions , what we will do . And then we're ready . We have forty minutes for this meeting . After that we'll have lunch . So first I wanna ask the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer to tell what he did . So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: That's my task . Okay . Uh I've {disfmarker} Where have I put it ? My Documents or not ? Hmm . I've save it on my computer , my presentation .
Project Manager: Yeah on your computer , or the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: But where ?
Project Manager: What's the name ?
Industrial Designer: Uh uh uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: What's the name of it ?
Industrial Designer: It was about the working of the remote control .
Project Manager: It's the technical function or the functional requirements .
Industrial Designer: Nope .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Not a {gap} of {disfmarker} Wait . The working design . But I've saved it .
Project Manager: Working design .
Industrial Designer: But now I don't know where it is . Hmm .
Project Manager: Working design . What is this ? Product documents .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . And I import this until {disfmarker}
Project Manager: On the desktop . Up . {gap} up . Up . Up .
Industrial Designer: One more .
Project Manager: Up .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yes . My Documents . Nope .
Industrial Designer: What the fuck is this ?
Project Manager: Gone . {vocalsound} Well you {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Nah . Nah , nah , nah .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: PowerPoint . Working design .
Industrial Designer: Yeah that's the empty one .
Project Manager: {vocalsound} And {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I had one .
Project Manager: Presentation of working design .
Industrial Designer: Uh-huh . Open it . Okay here it is .
Project Manager: Save as {gap} .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Uh it's {disfmarker}
Marketing: Desktop .
Project Manager: Project {gap} .
Industrial Designer: Project .
Marketing: Yeah . Okay . Well .
Project Manager: Save .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: Very good .
Industrial Designer: A little later but here it is .
Marketing: {gap}
Project Manager: Okay . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: So okay . It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you . It's about the working of the remote control . I just had an half an hour j to study it
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: and {vocalsound} I don't get it .
Marketing: {vocalsound} Make it .
Project Manager: Now have ten minutes to tell it .
Industrial Designer: Ten minutes to tell it . Okay . I think it will be a few minutes and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: First uh I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control . The working bout it {disfmarker} uh of it . Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map , and it's the top of the remote control . With a little bit of science , uh you {disfmarker} I will show that uh in in a few minutes . And then uh what I'll think about it . First , the findings . The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside . Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it ,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: um because its uh not so expensive . And there are uh a lot of uh wires , uh which um connect the components in it , the battery , and there are um switches and things like that . There's a lot of small uh electronics . So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it . Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it . Now {gap} {disfmarker} And here I have the top of the remote control . Uh here's some kind of chip . Uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers . Uh you have all on your remote control . And uh the teletext uh button . And uh here's the battery . And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . That's what I said , it's very difficult .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: And after that it will be sent to the infrared . And that will send it to your television . That's a short h uh how it works . Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult , but we all {vocalsound} we all don't get it . My preferences ? It's uh {disfmarker} it won't be uh {disfmarker} We shouldn't make it too big . Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . A long-lasting battery . Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . Not other materials . Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it . We can also make uh a button uh with a {gap} {disfmarker} menu uh button . And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ . And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: That's {disfmarker} I think it's easier . And the bleep signal , y uh you told us . Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep . Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something . And also the bleep , when {disfmarker} what I told you about uh when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it . This is uh just uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Oh oh . Two questions .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah .
Project Manager: The battery . You say one battery is cheaper . Why ?
Industrial Designer: If we w if we use only just one uh small pen-light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two .
Project Manager: Yeah but when you use two , you can use it two times longer .
Industrial Designer: Yeah but then we'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting .
Project Manager: Okay so it's the size of the remote control .
Industrial Designer: {gap} Just {disfmarker} Yeah .
Project Manager: Okay and the buttons . When you use it on the television , you've {disfmarker} you need the television , wh which can use it .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . But uh I think this {disfmarker} our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company ?
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: Or is it also for other company {disfmarker} uh for other televisions ?
Project Manager: I think we have to use it also on other televisions though .
Industrial Designer: Then this is an option . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions . And then we make it easier uh for our televisions . And on the other tele televisions , you can also use it , but then we won't use the
Project Manager: Yeah but I don't {disfmarker} I think it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} They are two different things though . We have to choose one . It has to work on o uh all televisions .
User Interface: Mm .
Industrial Designer: Yeah ? Okay . Then I think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions . And we will uh look forward and don't make a remote control which for the older televisions .
Marketing: Hmm .
Project Manager: Okay .
Industrial Designer: And I just uh have one more idea . Uh maybe it's one of your tasks . But {disfmarker} Uh , to have a trendy remote control , we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones . To change covers . So if you have uh a trendy half with all red , uh yellow and something . And then you can put a red cover on it .
Marketing: Hmm .
Industrial Designer: And also different things .
Project Manager: Yeah . Good idea .
Industrial Designer: Yes .
Marketing: Will this will this add to the cost ?
Industrial Designer: Uh then it won't be {disfmarker} uh will have just one cover on the uh original one . And then you can buy the covers .
Marketing: Yes but you have to m uh be able to change it . D does it make it more difficult to design ?
Industrial Designer: I think it will be a little more difficult , but not too much .
Project Manager: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Not much . 'Kay .
Industrial Designer: Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones .
Project Manager: Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones .
Industrial Designer: Just one .
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah but then we'll have to to just um put five covers on it , and see if it works . If it won't works then we'll get something else . Then we uh won't g uh go further with it .
Project Manager: Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost ?
Industrial Designer: Uh a p a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a cover made in uh in China , it it won't be I guess so expensive I think .
Project Manager: Yeah but there are also design cost . I don't think {disfmarker} When you have a remote control , do you change the cover ? Would you change the cover ?
Industrial Designer: Maybe . I wi I won't .
Project Manager: No .
Industrial Designer: But maybe I think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it , and uh the the children think , oh this is my remote control , uh I made a picture on it . Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: N yeah but {disfmarker} I think that too less people would change it for good profit . So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah . Okay . And the other people ? What do you think about it ? {vocalsound}
Marketing: Um {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah it's a good idea . But {disfmarker} If if it {disfmarker} Yeah , I don't {disfmarker} I'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: {gap}
User Interface: But it's uh yeah it's uh original idea . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yes it is but I don't think we have to do it .
User Interface: No .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Marketing: Mm .
Industrial Designer: You're the Project Manager . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yes . That's it .
Project Manager: That's clear . {vocalsound} Okay thank you . So now the User Interface Designer .
User Interface: Oh . That's me . Uh {disfmarker} Come on . {gap} . Ah .
Marketing: Yeah .
User Interface: Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh {disfmarker} for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set . Uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way . No cords attached . And uh well , it all by pushing a button on the remote . That was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting . Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web . Uh well the same idea here . Uh message to the television . And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off , and uh switching channels , and uh {disfmarker} and maybe uh teletext or something like that . Uh well these are two uh remotes , and that's our uh our dilemma I think . Uh {disfmarker} We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is . But uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more . Or uh uh more functions on the remote . Uh maybe more devices you can influence . Uh a radio or a v a video recorder , uh V_C_R_ . {vocalsound} Yeah well that's our dilemma . Um any ideas about that ? Basic or multifunctional ?
Project Manager: We'll got back on that later .
User Interface: Okay yeah . Yeah well the {disfmarker} that was just on my mind .
Marketing: Yes .
User Interface: So uh I didn't know what uh what way we would go . Mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk {vocalsound} .
Industrial Designer: 'Kay .
Project Manager: 'Kay , thank you . Then it's your turn , the marketing expert .
Marketing: Okay . Uh um m Yeah . {vocalsound} Um yeah okay . This bit too far . {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So {disfmarker} So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market , about um yeah what people think . Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . And we looked at uh several um things . Uh among them design , uh d d how d did they like the use of it , uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls . Uh well what what will be our market . And uh we asked them if we had some new featu features . If um that would be a good idea or not . Well our findings . Uh our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls . Um uh they especially found found them very ugly . And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it . Uh well they also zap a lot . So uh zapping uh should be very easy . And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . So a lot of unused buttons . There is more findings . Uh on the buttons . Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not ? And how much would they use them ? Well uh the most used button is the channel selection . And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are . The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant . Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important . Uh not important they found the audio , uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch , or the left or right . Uh the screen and the brightness . And uh channel settings . Uh th and they also are not used very often . Then we have a few um graphs about the market . Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups . Um as you can see , most users are uh between thirty six and forty five . Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . And to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh I don't think uh , I {vocalsound} I think the younger will be most interest in it . But uh they are not a very big group . Um in the {gap} we asked them , uh how would you like a s a new feature . If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control , what would you think of it . Now you can clearly see young users say {gap} . I will {disfmarker} that would very nice . And older user think uh they will be scared of change {vocalsound} I think .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: And they won't like it . And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it . Well here we see the same . Young users uh think that's an interesting idea . And old users not . Uh well we uh found out that there are two {disfmarker} several markets at which we can aim . Uh the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five . Uh they are highly interested in the features , as you can see uh here . And um they are more critical on their money spending . Uh the second group is the older group . Aged between forty six and sixty five . They are less interested in uh new features . But uh they spend their money more easily . Now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent . And the second group about forty percent . So the the first group is bigger . Well then I come to my uh personal preferences . Uh yeah the first question is uh {disfmarker} also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at . Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it . But less of them will buy it . Um well I uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . What I thought , um even young people say it's hard to use , remote control . So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use , that's especially aimed at this group , even uh the young group will also be more interested . And um we can make special features . But uh I think it looks nice in the first time . But when use it , uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Marketing: Um well th uh that's my second point .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control . It's about discussion we had earlier . Um {disfmarker} You can find most functions on a T_V_ set . So uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness . And such things . Um well the design is very important . One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one . But they found most remote controls very ugly . So the design of our remote control is very important . And uh yeah it should be very zap friendly , as most users use it for that . That were my findings .
Project Manager: Okay thank you .
Industrial Designer: Yeah . I have uh one question .
Project Manager: Yes .
Industrial Designer: If we aim for the younger people , um and there will be uh a lot of features like L_C_D_ or the the the speech uh f recognising , uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Industrial Designer: Uh I think we don't have that in our budget .
Marketing: Yes .
User Interface: No .
Industrial Designer: Do you think ?
Marketing: No .
User Interface: And I don't uh I don't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something .
Industrial Designer: Like {disfmarker} No . No .
User Interface: So it's {disfmarker} Yeah , it's hard to uh get the younger group .
Industrial Designer: Uh-huh .
Project Manager: I think uh the L_C_D_ is cheaper than speech recognition . So I think that can be an d good option . L_C_D_ .
User Interface: Mm-hmm . Just the L_C_D_ ?
Project Manager: Yes . Only the L_C_D_ .
User Interface: Mm-hmm .
Project Manager: So {disfmarker} But we'll come back on that .
Marketing: Okay .
Project Manager: Now {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh , go on . What d d d um {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Uh we go {gap} {disfmarker} back on the decisions later . Now we have a few new product requirements . First , teletext . We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore . So not necessary .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Next . Only for the television . So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something . Only the television . We look at the age group of forty plus . Uh no , younger than forty . Is a g big group , and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff . Fourth point . {vocalsound} Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . Very important for the design . So you can see it on our site .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Next . Um no . We have to make our decisions , what we want to do . So {vocalsound} like you said , we need the {disfmarker} {gap} . Maybe it's good to put it in a document . Now we have to decide what controls do we need . So maybe you can tell us .
Marketing: Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said .
Project Manager: Sorry ?
Marketing: The the requirements you just said ,
Project Manager: Yes .
Marketing: maybe we should first have a discussion about that .
Project Manager: Yes , it's okay .
Marketing: I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news .
Project Manager: Yeah but we don't use it . It's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} new requirement .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So , it's not my requirement .
Industrial Designer: 'Kay , we'll just have to do that .
Project Manager: We have to do this .
Industrial Designer: Okay . No discussion about it .
Marketing: Okay . Okay sorry .
Project Manager: No .
Marketing: Then uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Okay . {vocalsound} Unfortunately .
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So what controls do we need ? Who first ?
User Interface: Well a power button ?
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay . Uh power .
User Interface: Uh the well um I think separate channels . So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Uh mm channel .
User Interface: But then both the the separate channels . So so uh zero to nine or something .
Project Manager: Channel {disfmarker} Zero to nine .
User Interface: Uh volume .
Project Manager: Volume . Maybe it's easy to pick . What was w your one ? Techno
Marketing: Mine ? It's the functional requirements .
Project Manager: Okay . We had w uh no no no no . Where was that example of the {disfmarker}
User Interface: Oh mine .
Project Manager: Johan . That was the {disfmarker} the the the the {disfmarker} {gap}
User Interface: Technical .
Project Manager: technical {disfmarker} Hallo . Okay . What do we need ? On-off . Zero to nine .
Industrial Designer: To change to the next channel , just one button . To move up , move down .
Project Manager: Yeah that's the channel .
Marketing: D Yeah . Do we make a menu ?
Project Manager: Menu ? Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus . Uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {gap} {disfmarker} M Menu . I think um the only one or two numbers .
User Interface: Mm yes .
Project Manager: And {disfmarker} Hello ? That's ch {vocalsound}
Marketing: {gap} I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . Up-down for channel selection ,
Project Manager: Yes .
Marketing: and left-right uh for volume . And uh a menu uh button . And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . But the {disfmarker} then to scroll through the menu and to change the options .
Project Manager: On the L_C_D_ screen , you mean ?
Marketing: Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_ . Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control .
Project Manager: Think it's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions . So
Marketing: Yes .
Project Manager: we need {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: But then we come to the costs .
Project Manager: N Yes . But if we have this {disfmarker}
Marketing: 'Kay . But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control . And also to find the easy to use uh part very important . So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost , it will still sell .
Project Manager: So now we don't have a lot of buttons . Is this enough ?
User Interface: Mute .
Project Manager: Mute . Maybe in the menu ?
User Interface: Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm .
User Interface: Yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh thing to do .
Project Manager: Mute . Mm-hmm . Okay .
Marketing: Yeah .
Project Manager: Maybe more ? {vocalsound} {vocalsound} No . Well . Then that's all . This will be the buttons . And {disfmarker} I think that's enough for the next phase . So we can go on to {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: But now we have only the buttons .
Project Manager: Yes .
Industrial Designer: And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? Or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: No that's for the next phase .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Project Manager: Um {gap} {disfmarker} Phase two is the conceptual design . So then we'll have the concepts .
Industrial Designer: Okay . Okay .
Project Manager: That's for the {disfmarker} So uh next point . Now we have lunch-break . After that we have t thirty minutes for work . And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons . No . Your individual action , you can find them in the email . So now it's time for lunch .
Industrial Designer: Okay .
Marketing: Okay . Good idea .
Project Manager: Thanks for coming .
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
