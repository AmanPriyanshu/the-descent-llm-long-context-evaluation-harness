Mary: There are a lot of things you can do to make you feel more confident and less nervous.

Jennifer: I have done a lot of research on the subject, and I know I can answer any questions I will receive from the audience.
Mary: The next thing that you need is an outline of your presentation. You should think about how to effectively present the subject matter.
Jennifer: You mean what I should talk about, or more precisely the sequence of my presentation?
Mary: Yes, what you should present first, second, third…
Jennifer: If that is the case, then I already have an outline. To make it easy for my audience to follow the presentation, I intend to post the outline on the board at all time during my speech.
Mary: Good idea! By the way, do you have any facts to back you up? For example, change of climate, yearly disasters…
Jennifer: No, I have not thought about that. I better get some statistics from the Internet. I should not have any problems since the Internet has all kinds of data.

Jennifer: No, it is another thing to add to my To Do list. I guess I will need at least two or three pictures to persuade people about the dangers of global warming.
Mary: Pictures will keep your audience from being bored. In order for you to succeed, you need to keep them interested and involved.
Jennifer: What else do I need? Is there anything else I can do to help me relax and be at ease during my presentation?
Mary: You need to practice your presentation. Just pretend that you are standing in front of your audience and start to give your speech.
Jennifer: Pretending is one thing; actually giving a speech is another thing.
Mary: Think positive. Tell yourself that you can do it without any problems.
Jennifer: I guess I can look at this as a presentation of my point of view to my friends.

Jennifer: I need to do this presentation really well. This is my first presentation in front of a big audience, and it is so important to me.
Mary: This is only the beginning, Jennifer. Being able to express your ideas with confidence and clarity is one of the best skills to possess.

Mary: I know you. You can do it. Good luck, Jennifer!

Sandra: Well, you'll never believe it, but Brenda Riley tracked me down like this and we met up last weekend! We thought we might get the old Lister's gang together for a reunion, you know, before we're all too old!
Pat: You're not too old, you were all young girls out of school then!
Sandra: Yes, but that was almost 50 years ago, Pat! We're all grannies now!
Pat: Not me, we never had kids, our choice!
Sandra: You have no regrets, then?
Pat: Bit personal, dear! No, we retired from the pub 10 years ago, mid-60s, me and Jon have had a ball, cruises, safaris and I've seen my sister in Oz and my brother in Thailand several times.
