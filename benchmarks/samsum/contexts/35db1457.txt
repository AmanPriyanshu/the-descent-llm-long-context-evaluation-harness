Dialogue: Larry: Hey, what did you write for the conclusion of your english essay?
Diana: The one on the Pygmalian?
Larry: yeah
Diana: haven't started it yet.
Larry: ok. what about the hemingway essay?
Diana: er, i think i wrote something along the lines of: "Throughout the book, it can be observed how the lost generation struggles to overcome their experience with the war" 
Diana: then i listed a couple of examples
Diana: and THEN i compared those characters to Robert Cohn
Larry: not bad :)
Diana: then I think i ended it with: 
Diana: "However, in the last few lines of the book, we can see a change in Jake Barnes, the narrator of the book. This is especially noticeable in when Lady Brett says: "... we could have had such a damn good time together." This quote suggests that Lady Brett is still focused on the events of the past, which prevents her from persuing happiness. Jake, on the other hand, replies "Yes, isn't it pretty to think so?" - a quote which suggests that he has accepted his past and is now looking towards the future.
Diana: It still needs a little polishing though :)
Larry: Has anyone ever told you that you're really good at this kind of thing? :)
Diana: I just pay attention and take notes. Sparknotes help ;)
