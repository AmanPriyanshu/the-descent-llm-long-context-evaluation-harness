Dialogue: Adam: I don't know what to do, it's the sixth time I failed
Betty: Don't give up! It happens, you know how it is - a little bit of skill, a little bit of luck
Jake: What happened?
Adam: I failed the driving test :(
Jake: I didn't know you were doing it!
Adam: Well, technically I'm not, I'm still trying
Adam: and failing

Jessie: First after ten years and three fails!
Betty: Exactly, don't give up. I know people who tried more than ten times and they passed in the end
Jake: Maybe you should change your teacher?
Adam: Greg's amazing, I think it's my fault
Jake: I'm not saying it's his fault, but I think it's good to drive with different people, everyone can teach something else
Betty: I can give you my teacher's number, he's great
Jessie: I agree, also, it took me so long because I simply couldn't relax, maybe you simply want it a little bit too much
Adam: Of course I want it. I really need to pass it
Jessie: I get it, I do, but it's crazy difficult to pass when you're tense and stressed, your examiner can see it and they may think that you don't feel confident in the car
Adam: Because I don't. How am I supposed to feel confident if I don't have a driving licence
Betty: It's a vicious circle Adam. You do need to relax, take a deep breath and try again
Jake: I don't think it's generally a good idea, but sometimes having a break helps - like in Jessie's case
Jessie: I think I wasn't mature enough to drive, it's difficult to admit it, but that's how it was
Adam: I will try with a different teacher first and then I'll sign up for a new exam
Adam: Seventh....
Betty: Adam, it's not a race
Summary: Adam failed his driving test for the sixth time. Jessie passed her driving test after ten years. Adam will find a different teacher and sign up for a new exam.
