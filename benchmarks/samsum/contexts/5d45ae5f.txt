Dialogue: Jennifer: I will have to give a presentation on global warming on Friday, and I am so nervous.
Mary: There are a lot of things you can do to make you feel more confident and less nervous.
Jennifer: What should I do, Mary?
Mary: First of all, you need to understand the subject matter thoroughly. You need to know what is global warming, what causes global warming, and what people should do to abate the effects of global warming.
Jennifer: I have done a lot of research on the subject, and I know I can answer any questions I will receive from the audience.
Mary: The next thing that you need is an outline of your presentation. You should think about how to effectively present the subject matter.
Jennifer: You mean what I should talk about, or more precisely the sequence of my presentation?
Mary: Yes, what you should present first, second, third…
Jennifer: If that is the case, then I already have an outline. To make it easy for my audience to follow the presentation, I intend to post the outline on the board at all time during my speech.
Mary: Good idea! By the way, do you have any facts to back you up? For example, change of climate, yearly disasters…
Jennifer: No, I have not thought about that. I better get some statistics from the Internet. I should not have any problems since the Internet has all kinds of data.
Mary: Good. It is easier to convince people and to hold their attention with actual data. It would be even better if you show some pictures along the way. Do you have any?
Jennifer: No, it is another thing to add to my To Do list. I guess I will need at least two or three pictures to persuade people about the dangers of global warming.
Mary: Pictures will keep your audience from being bored. In order for you to succeed, you need to keep them interested and involved.
Jennifer: What else do I need? Is there anything else I can do to help me relax and be at ease during my presentation?
Mary: You need to practice your presentation. Just pretend that you are standing in front of your audience and start to give your speech.
Jennifer: Pretending is one thing; actually giving a speech is another thing.
Mary: Think positive. Tell yourself that you can do it without any problems.
Jennifer: I guess I can look at this as a presentation of my point of view to my friends.
Mary: If you are really prepared, it will be a piece of cake. You will be able to speak with ease and confidence, and you will be amazed by how well you can express yourself.
Jennifer: I need to do this presentation really well. This is my first presentation in front of a big audience, and it is so important to me.
Mary: This is only the beginning, Jennifer. Being able to express your ideas with confidence and clarity is one of the best skills to possess.
Jennifer: You are absolutely right. I will take time to practice and to learn to relax and express myself really well. Wish me luck, Mary!
Mary: I know you. You can do it. Good luck, Jennifer!

Dialogue: Joona: Hey you two wonderful people, like I said to Kamil already let me know if there's something that you really, really want to do once you're in NY
Kamil: I am getting panicked before Boston
Kamil: so I just want to survive it first
Kamil: but then maybe some art Moma, ESB, maybe ellis island? the statue? but maybe you have some suggestions?
Kamil: oh, and the famous beach place?
Kamil: Anca? any ideas?
Kamil: but we don't need to see all at once. We also need hints how to do it all cheaply 😂
Joona: Coney Island? The beach with the amusement park? It's cool, it's just off-season right now, so it's quite empty and eerie 👻
Joona: Ok, I'll think about cheap possibilities and ideas 🙂 Plus you'll nail Boston! (It's also an awesome city!)
Kamil: i think so!
Kamil: hmm, it's so much to see, but I would also rely on your opinions :) you've been there for a while
Anca: Oh god Joona, how nice to care for us lost people, facing the ultimate metropolis for the first time
Anca: If Kamil is afraid of Boston, I am afraid of being send back by the homeland security, as it happened to me in the UK before taking the Italian citizenship, so I still can't quite believe that I will get to New York 😅
Anca: But, just in case, I would like to do Moma and the empire state building, I am not sure about a show on Broadway. And I would like to see coney island out of season, as you might have noticed already, we like absurd things 😅
Anca: And the Brooklyn Bridge but I don't know, do these things need to be arranged, or one can just go? Moma for example, or the esb?
Joona: Well, maybe planned is a better word for it 😀 Like if you want to see a show on Broadway, queuing for cheap tickets is a special process. And Guggenheim, for example, is pay-what-you-wish on Saturday evenings, Whitney on Friday evenings - MoMA sadly is always the same price but I'll make some kind of list of things 🙂
Anca: So yes, we need some plans!
Anca: Oh thank you 😍 How is the weather? Decent?
Joona: At the moment it's cold and first snow came last week
Anca: In Bucharest as well
Joona: But decent, beats rain
Anca eui: So nothing shocking I suppose
Joona: No, just keep an eye out for the forecast before you leave to Boston as 1) it can change really quickly here 2) Boston can be extremely cold with the wind and all
Anca: So probably colder than NY? Ok, we will try to arrive there prepared
Joona: 😂
Anca: Ok, for now both cities are warmer than Bucharest. But the cold doesn't scare me too much
Kamil: I will buy new shoes😂 but that's great you know when and where are free options!🤩
Kamil: a real NYC-know-how
Joona: What can I say, I'm stingy 😏 and want my free culture 😀
Kamil: perfect! so are we!
Summary: Anca and Kamil are travelling to Boston and New York for holiday and need recommendations. Anca and Kamil are interested in culture and want to see some New York landmarks. Joona recommends some tourist attractions and gives tips on how to get into museums more cheaply.
