Tarquin: Did you make an event on Facebook?
Quentin: Yes I did. You didn't see it?
Tarquin: I haven't been on for a few days. Actually I got a ban for making a joke which offended someone. It involved a penguin, which as you know can be a very offensive topic.

Quentin: About 200, like the other time.
Tarquin: how many did you sell on the spot? 
Quentin: Only 30, the rest went into the shop. But the prices are better than the labels I would put on them, especially when you get an impromptu auction going. Nigel always likes to outbid Helen. I asked Helen to pretend to be interested in more books than she really is just to keep Nigel getting his wallet out.
Tarquin: Hah hah! I imagine she was only too happy to oblige. 
Quentin: Naturally. Top sort, that Helen.
Tarquin: What was that book they were bidding so hard over last time?
Quentin: Oh. That was that book on Stalin by Simon Sebag Montefiore. I think I have about three copies of that around the shop priced up at ten zlotys each.
Tarquin: And what did Nigel end up paying?
Quentin: 52 zlotys in the end. I could barely keep the smile off my face.
Tarquin: But it's really only the fun and games I think. He must have known he was overpaying and just doing it for a lark, because of the social evening.
Quentin: Yes, that's probably it. Which is why I like to be generous with the wine and cheese. Especially the wine, I might add.
Tarquin: Yes. That's from Peter's company right?
Quentin: indeed. And I can take orders for crates of them at a special "Quentin price" only on the evening of the unboxing. I'll be doing that tonight as well if you want anything for Christmas wine-wise.
Summary: Quentin has had another delivery and is organizing an unboxing at 8 pm tonight. He made an event on Facebook and there will be 7 people. Quentin will do some wine and cheese. Tarquin will be there too. There might be about 200 books. Quentin sold 30 and the rest went into the shop.
