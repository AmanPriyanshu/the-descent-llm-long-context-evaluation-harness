Dialogue: Ann: I have got a plusnet mobile sim card that I pay 5.00  a month for it has 500 minutes, 100 more than the skype one, plus I have a decent phone that I can use with it, not my own

Rob: We can then measure how many CS notepads call us and adjust the monthly package accordingly

Rob: Im setting up a new 0333 number - what is your mobile number?

Rob: ok no rush
Ann: Did you sort out the Cawson invoice?
Rob: oh no good job you reminded me I will do it now

Rob: I think they had quite a few this month, I need to get onto Chris Lamport and hurry up his reports as I cant send them an invoice if they dont have all the reports
Ann: Hes getting annoying being late with reports all the time
Rob: I'm thinking about cutting his jobs, hes getting a bit too comfortable
Ann: well that wont hurt for a while, he is taking more local tutors jobs really
Ann: I know its great that he is able to cover areas that we are short on but apart from that we should leave him to his own area
Rob: I think you are right good idea
