The Hunter (Blondie album)
The Hunter is the sixth studio album by the American band Blondie, released in May 1982.  It was Blondie's last album of new material until 1999's No Exit. It was recorded in the fall of 1981 and January and February 1982. 

Overview 

The Hunter is loosely a concept album based on the theme: searching, pursuing, and hunting.  Tracks on the album include Jimmy Destri's Motown pastiche "Danceway", while "Dragonfly" has a science-fiction theme to its lyrics about a race in space. "The Beast" deals with Deborah Harry's experiences of becoming a public figure: "I am the centre of attraction, by staying off the streets". "English Boys" is Harry and Chris Stein's melancholy tribute to "those English boys who had long hair", The Beatles, recorded the year after John Lennon's assassination in New York City, describing the innocence and idealism of the 60's, while "War Child" references military conflicts in Cambodia and the Middle East. The album concludes with a cover version of Smokey Robinson's "The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game", originally recorded by The Marvelettes in 1967.  

The song "For Your Eyes Only" was originally written for the 1981 James Bond film of the same name. The producers of the film, however, favored a track composed by Bill Conti and Michael Leeson and asked Blondie to record that song instead.  Blondie declined, the Conti/Leeson song was passed on to Sheena Easton. Blondie opted to release their song (written by Debbie Harry and Chris Stein) on The Hunter.

Two singles were released from the album, "Island of Lost Souls" and "War Child" (the latter of which was also released as a 12" extended version). "Danceway" was planned for release as a single in Canada (backed with "For Your Eyes Only")  but the single was withdrawn.

In the liner notes to the 2001 reissue of The Hunter, producer Mike Chapman stated "I knew that we were in a different and far less accessible artistic space. And that worried me. I could tell that things were different now, and I knew that this would be the last Blondie album."

Release and Reception

The album peaked at #9 in the UK, #15 in Australia and #33 in the US. Compared to Blondie's three previous albums with Mike Chapman as producer (Parallel Lines, Eat to the Beat and Autoamerican), The Hunter proved to be a disappointment, both commercially and critically. Six months after its release, the band splintered. The summer Tracks Across America Tour '82 was set to promote the album, but turned out to be unsuccessful. The band's European tour which was due to follow in autumn was cancelled. 

The Hunter was digitally remastered and reissued by Chrysalis Records UK in 1994, and again by EMI-Capitol in 2001, both times with the 12" version of "War Child" as the only bonus track.

Passage:
The Viper Room
The Viper Room is a nightclub located on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, California. It was opened in 1993 and was partly owned by actor Johnny Depp until 2004. The club became known for being a hangout of Hollywood elite, and was the site where actor River Phoenix died of a drug overdose on Halloween morning in 1993. In early 1995, Australian singer Jason Donovan suffered a drug-induced seizure at the club and survived. The Viper Room has undergone several changes in ownership, and continues to host music of multiple genres, including metal, punk rock, and alternative rock.

The space where the club is located was originally a jazz bar called the Melody Room, a hangout of mobsters Bugsy Siegel and Mickey Cohen.  In the 1970s and 1980s it operated as a club called The Central, which was close to shutting down before Chuck E. Weiss, who had performed there for years, suggested to Depp that they revitalize the spot and rename it "The Viper Room".  Tom Waits also had a hand in redeveloping the spot. 

While predominantly known as a music venue, The Viper Room also hosts a lower level below the stage and audience area, which is home to a large and well stocked whiskey bar. The whiskey bar boasts a diverse selection, ranging from Jack Daniel's, Crown Royal, and other commonly available whiskeys, to  rarer or more local whiskeys such as Slow Hand White Whiskey, Hochstadter's Slow & Low Rock & Rye, and numerous types of small batch whiskey.

History

The venue

Despite the death of River Phoenix the year the venue opened, the club became and remained a hangout for Hollywood’s most popular young actors and musicians. Regulars included Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Marie Presley, Jared Leto, Christina Applegate, Angelina Jolie, Rosario Dawson, Tobey Maguire, and Leonardo DiCaprio. Adam Duritz, the lead singer of Counting Crows, worked as a Viper Room bartender in late 1994 – early 1995 to escape his newfound fame.  Johnny Cash performed at the venue, debuting material that would later appear in his 1994 album American Recordings.  In 1997 The Viper Room was also a place of a few early solo live performances by John Frusciante at the time of his bad physical condition caused by drug abuse. The Pussycat Dolls performed there from 1995 to 2001.

At Depp's request, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers performed at the club's opening night.  The Viper Room continues to frequently host metal and punk rock bands. The first live U.S. performance of doom metal supergroup Shrinebuilder in 2009 was held at the venue, as part of Club My War, which hosts bands at The Viper Room on a near monthly basis.

In film

In the 1983 film Valley Girl, the building (then housing a nightclub called The Central) was used for scenes featuring the new-wave band the Plimsouls. In Oliver Stone’s film The Doors (1991), the building was used as a filming location for scenes depicting the London Fog, also of West Hollywood. London Fog was a lesser-known nightclub next to the Whisky a Go Go where the Doors had their first regular gigs for four months in early 1966. 

The Viper Room is also featured in the 2004 documentary DiG! when members of the band the Brian Jonestown Massacre began brawling with each other on stage while performing.

Ownership

As part of the settlement of a lawsuit involving the disappearance of co-owner Anthony Fox in 2001, Depp relinquished his ownership of the Viper Room in 2004.  The club was purchased by Darin Feinstein in 2004. Feinstein maintains majority ownership to this day.  In 2015, Feinstein noted:

When Johnny Depp founded the Viper Room he created an iconic brand that will live on forever. The venue grew from a gritty Rock and Roll lifestyle statement to one of the most prolific nightclubs, not just on the Sunset strip, but in the world. People from all parts of life are drawn to the Viper Room, the eclectic nature of its crowd is intense, and superstar bands from all over the world love to play there.  

Intellectual Property & Lawsuits

A nightclub located in Cincinnati, Ohio, was formerly called "The Viper Room". The club changed its name to "The Poison Room" on January 1, 2006, after they were told by the West Hollywood Viper Room to stop using the name.  Another "Viper Room" in Portland, Oregon, has also been told to stop using the name under threat of a trademark lawsuit, with owner Darin Feinstein claiming "Every dollar they make is the result of using our name."   Additionally, there is a legal brothel in Brisbane, Australia called 'The Viper Room'. There is also a nightclub in Stockholm, Sweden, "as well as ones in Harrogate, UK, Vienna, Austria, and another in Sheffield UK similarly named." Until February 2009 there was a nightclub with the same name in Melbourne, Australia; it was closed down due to a spate of violent incidents that included two shootings as well as license breaches and the arrest of a co-owner on drug charges.  On April 16, 2011, a nightclub named "The Viper Room" opened its doors in the city of Nijmegen in the Netherlands. The club is named after the club in Hollywood and is decorated in the same style as the US club.  In 2016, The Viper Room began issuing cease and desist notices to bootleg merchandise sellers on eBay and other online storefronts. 

Merchandising

In 2016, The Viper Room announced the launch of a new line of officially-licensed high-end apparel. The website Shop Viper Room was established to promote the new vintage-inspired fashion items.
Question:
Who owned the LA nightclub The Viper Room at the time of River Phoenix's death there in 1993?

Johnny deep

Snooker champion Charlton dies

Australia's greatest snooker player Eddie Charlton died in New Zealand today, eight days after his 75th birthday.
Charlton became ill shortly after arriving across the Tasman on a promotional and exhibition visit last Friday. He was admitted to Palmerston North Hospital yesterday and died in intensive care today, a hospital spokesman said.
He had been suffering from a tumour in the bile duct for some time and died of a cardiac arrest.
"Eddie was still actively playing the game he had loved for so long right to the end," said friend and colleague Ian Anderson, president of the World Pool Association.
Charlton, who learned to play the game as a child in his grandfather's snooker parlour in the Hunter Valley coal town of Swansea, was Australian professional champion 20 times.
He won the world matchplay title and the World Open, and was ranked in the top three in the world for several years.
But he never won the world championship, losing the final three times, to John Pullman in 1968 and to Ray Reardon in 1973 and 1975.
He also reached the final of the world billiards championship three times, in 1974, 1976 and 1984.
"Steady Eddie" was best known for his appearances on the British television program Pot Black, where his poker face and down-to-earth Australian humour helped win the program and the game a cult following.
He had many great battles with contemporaries like Reardon, John Spencer and Alex "Hurricane" Higgins.
"In his prime he was always in the top three players in the world, and it was a toss-up whether Reardon, Spencer or Eddie was the best," Anderson said.
Charlton loved his time on Pot Black, which he credited with spreading the game worldwide.
"It had a big influence, particularly on young people. I started to notice school boys and girls playing in different places," Charlton said in an ABC TV interview earlier this year.
"There were so many countries that were taking Pot Black. It's a shame that it ever stopped, because it was one of the top sports programs."
Charlton grew up in the Hunter Valley and worked in the coal mines for 15 years before becoming a professional snooker player in 1963.
He was a good all-round sportsman, and was in the Swansea crew which won the Australian surf boat title. He also carried the torch before the 1956 Melbourne Olympics.
He was a useful tennis, cricket and soccer player and a talented amateur boxer who once went a few rounds with world champion Dave Sands to raise money for his surf club.
He and Sands came from the same part of the world, and became friendly travelling home on the train from Sydney together.
Members at Sydney Tattersalls club, where Charlton had been a member for 30 years, were saddened to learn of his death today.
"He's been once of the great champions in his field - an Australian icon," said club treasurer Denis Pidcock.
"He was always very generous in helping the members with their games, and he'll be very sorely missed."
Charlton was married twice, to Gloria and Robyn, and is survived by five children and eight grandchildren.
He was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in 1980 and won an Australian Sports Medal in 2001.

Passage:
Wendy Toms
Wendy Toms (born 16 October 1962 ) is an English former football referee from Broadstone, Dorset  who has officiated in the Football League and then the Premier League, both as an assistant referee. She was the first female ever to fulfil such roles at those levels. She also served for FIFA on the women's international list. Her other occupation is as a parcel post manager. 

Career

Toms took up refereeing in the late 1980s,  and progressed to become a reserve (now "fourth") official in the Football League in 1991 for the Bournemouth versus Reading match in the old Third Division, which was then unique for a female. She was the first woman to be included on the list of Football League assistant referees when she was chosen for the 1994-95 season, and became a referee in the Football Conference two seasons later,  creating another precedent when she took charge of the game between Kidderminster and Nuneaton Borough her first Conference match as referee.  Almost a year after that, she operated as an assistant referee in the Premier League, again, the first female ever to do so.

Two years after her debut in that league, and having 'run the line' for referee Steve Dunn during Leeds United's 4-3 Premiership away win at Coventry City on 11 September 1999,  she was roundly criticised by the then Coventry manager, Gordon Strachan, who said in an interview with The Independent newspaper: "We are getting PC decisions about promoting ladies. It does not matter if they are ladies, men or Alsatian dogs. If they are not good enough to run the line they should not get the job. Saturday's was the worst assistant refereeing decision I have seen this season by far and I've said that in my report. The fourth Leeds goal was offside by at least four yards and there were numerous other bad decisions in the game. My message is don't be politically correct and promote people just for the sake of it." However, the president of the Referees' Association at the time, Peter Willis, replied: "She's a very good official...I think the situation is very sad. As a manager of a football club, Strachan is responsible for his players and he is entitled to his opinion on the performance of the officials, but to talk about the sex of the official is irrelevant." 

Toms' highest domestic honour was being appointed as an assistant for the Football League Cup Final between Leicester City and Tranmere at Wembley on 27 February 2000,  when the referee was Alan Wilkie. Leicester won this 2-1, with Toms indicating offside at one point to cause the Tranmere (and former Leicester) player David Kelly's "equalising goal" to be disallowed.  She was also an assistant referee in two matches at the 2000 Olympic Games, having been selected by FIFA to operate on their women's international list.

She took charge of the UEFA Women's Cup quarter-final first leg on 30 October 2003 between Brøndby IF of Denmark and Gomrukçu Baku of Azerbaijan, with the Danish side running out 9-0 winners. 

Toms refereed one match at the 2005 UEFA Women's Championship in England. This was the Group B match at Deepdale in Preston on 6 June 2005, between France and Italy, which finished 3-1 to the French. 

Although no longer officiating at the highest level, Toms still referees in the Football Conference. 

Wendy Toms was also named in derogatory fashion during the Richard Keys and Andy Gray rant regarding women officiating elite football matches in late 2010, which cost the two broadcasters their jobs.
Question:
In 1994 Wendy Toms became the first female official in which sport?
Answer:
Football League

"Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is a group therapy program for people suffering from alcoholism." Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is a group therapy program for people suffering from alcoholism. Its core treatment philosophy is based on a personal improvement plan that is outlined in 12 specific action steps. AA step 9 of the 12 steps is a call for recovering alcoholics to make amends. It builds on step 8, which required the individual to make a list of everyone he or she has harmed throughout the battle with alcohol addiction.
This 12-step program has achieved widespread acceptance and forms the basis of AA programs operated by chapters around the world. The program's philosophy has been adapted for use by other types of addiction recovery programs , such as for drug use and excessive gambling. The mandate to make amends in Alcoholics Anonymous step 9 is indicative of the program's approach to healing the emotional and spiritual aspects of a person, as well as ameliorating the physical and mental side effects of addiction.
Step 9: Be Willing to Make Amends
Step 9 requires the recovering alcoholic to be willing to go to any lengths to make amends. The individual must be willing to take this step no matter how severe the personal consequences. If making amends requires the person to report a past crime, he or she must be willing to go to jail to complete this step on the road to recovery. The spiritual aspect of the mandate encourages the recovering individual to seek strength and guidance to do the right thing from a higher power and from the others engaged in the program.
Step 9 requires the recovering alcoholic to be willing to go to any lengths to make amends.
The way a recovering alcoholic transitions into the 9th step of Alcoholics Anonymous is to take the list he or she created of people harmed from step 8 and divide the list into four categories. These categories determine the way the person approaches the process of making amends. The first category should include all of the people to whom the person can make full amends as soon as he or she is sober. The second category should include those people to whom the person will make partial amends, because full restitution would cause more harm than good.
The third category should include the people who should not be contacted until a full and certain recovery has been achieved. This might include a child who could be disappointed if a recovery process results in a relapse . Last, the fourth category should separate out anyone to whom it is impossible to make amends, such as a person who has since passed away. The guiding principal of this step is to make full amends at the earliest opportunity, as long as such action is feasible, proper, and will not cause additional harm.
Making amends must involve sincere efforts to apologize. The notion of being sincere involves adopting the right attitude before making an approach. A recovering alcoholic in the program is encouraged to forgive himself or herself and to forgive the person on the list for any actions done in retaliation. Step 9 should be pursued according to a plan that does not assign blame and allows the person who has been harmed the freedom to respond, even if the response is angry or unforgiving.
A recovering alcoholic who successfully completes step 9 can find the process has built a bridge to new relationships with friends and loved ones. It can also help to remove the guilt and shame of past actions that can act as a stumbling block to full recovery. You can find an AA meeting near you by visiting the website .

Passage:
Terry Jacks
Terrence Ross "Terry" Jacks (born March 29, 1944, Winnipeg, Manitoba) is a Canadian singer, songwriter, record producer and environmentalist, best known for his 1974 hit song "Seasons in the Sun".

Early life

Terry Jacks was born and raised in Winnipeg. His family relocated to Vancouver in the early 1960s. Jacks took up guitar in his teens and at 18 formed a band called The Chessmen with guitarist Guy Sobell. The group had four top-ten hits in Vancouver between 1964 and 1966.

Following The Chessmen, Terry and Susan Pesklevits (Susan Jacks), whom he later married, formed The Poppy Family along with Craig McCaw and Satwant Singh. They had several hits in Canada and internationally, their biggest being "Which Way You Goin' Billy?", which went to #1 in Canada and #2 on the Billboard charts in the U.S. The song was written and produced by Terry Jacks which earned him a Gold Leaf (Juno) award in 1970 for his production.

"Seasons in the Sun"

The song "Seasons in the Sun", released in late 1973 on his own record label, Goldfish Records, became the largest-selling international single by a Canadian artist at that time, eventually selling 14 million copies worldwide. It earned Jacks two Juno Awards and became one of the biggest selling Canadian Singles of all time. 

The song was based on Rod McKuen's 1965 re-write of "Le moribond", originally by Belgian singer Jacques Brel from 1962. For his version, Jacks made some modifications to the lyrics, which along with McKuen's, resulted in a work that bears little resemblance to Brel's original in tone, substance or poetry. In the United States,  in Great Britain  and in Germany,  it was released on Bell Records, and the song nonetheless went to #1 on the charts. In Canada it was released on his own label, Goldfish Records, distributed by London Records Canada. 

Jacks later released "If You Go Away" (another McKuen adaptation of a Jacques Brel song entitled "Ne Me Quitte Pas"), which reached #8 in Great Britain and #24 in Germany, and a cover of Kevin Johnson's "Rock 'N' Roll (I Gave You The Best Years Of My Life)", both of which had more success in Canada but also made the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the U.S. He wrote and recorded a number of other songs and went on to produce many artists including The Beach Boys with a version of "Seasons in the Sun" shortly before his own, but that was never released. He also produced the singles  "Crazy Talk"   and "There's Something I Like About That"   for Chilliwack from their album Riding High.

Jacks produced two songs for Nana Mouskouri: "Scarborough Fair" and "Loving Arms" in 1976. He produced the Vancouver top 10 hit "Country Boy Named Willy" for "SPRING" on London Records (#38 Canada); And Valdy's original version of "Rock and Roll Song" (b/w sometime "Sunday Morning"). The record was scheduled for release on London Records but was re-recorded in L.A. with another producer when Valdy signed a recording contract.  He also spent a lot of time with Buddy Knox in the 1970s and produced a single for him with two songs: "Me and You" (written by Jacks) and the George Jones song "White Lightnin'". The single remains unreleased.  Jacks also went on to produce a number of other artists in the 1980s and 1990s including DOA who recorded a punk rock version of "Where Evil Grows". 

Recently

In 2011, Jacks' friend Al Jardine released a new version of "Don't Fight The Sea", recorded along with fellow Beach Boys Mike Love, Brian Wilson, Bruce Johnston and the late Carl Wilson, who sang part of the lead vocal. A limited edition white vinyl 45 was made and sold to benefit Japanese Tsunami victims.  His brand new album release, "Starfish on the beach" is a double CD of 40 of his favorite tracks, from the last 40 years, and features some of his biggest hits of the 70s and 80s. The package contains a 32-page booklet with never before seen photos and Terry's recollections of his musical journey. It is now available from www.regeneratorrecords.com and in select stores throughout Canada.

Film

Jacks has worked in documentary film and video, producing several shorts on environmental themes including The Faceless Ones, The Tragedy of Clearcutting, The Southern Chilcotin Mountains and The Warmth of Love (The Four Seasons of Sophie Thomas) with cinematographer Ian Hinkle.  The video production The Faceless Ones earned an Environmental Gold Award from the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival. 

Personal life

In the late 1970s, Jacks gradually withdrew from the music world. He had a daughter, born in 1985. In the 1980s Jacks became involved in the environmental movement, focusing on pulp mill pollution issues in Canada. His environmental work has earned him several awards including one from the United Nations Association of Canada and the Western Canada Wilderness Committee. He was awarded a lifetime achievement award  in 1997 for his work, as well as the Eugene Rogers Environmental Award.

Mellow Yellow
"Mellow Yellow" is a song written and recorded by Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan.  It reached No. 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 in 1966 and No. 8 in the UK in early 1967.

Content

The song was rumoured to be about smoking dried banana skins, which was believed to be a hallucinogenic drug in the 1960s, though this aspect of bananas has since been debunked.  According to Donovan's notes, accompanying the album Donovan's Greatest Hits, the rumour that one could get high from smoking dried banana skins was started by Country Joe McDonald in 1966, and Donovan heard the rumour three weeks before "Mellow Yellow" was released as a single. According to The Rolling Stone Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll, he admitted later the song made reference to a vibrator; an "electrical banana" as mentioned in the lyrics.  This definition was re-affirmed in an interview with NME magazine: "it's about being cool, laid-back, and also the electrical bananas that were appearing on the scene - which were ladies' vibrators." 

The phrase "mellow yellow" appears towards the end of James Joyce's novel Ulysses, where it is used to refer to Mrs. Marion Bloom's buttocks.  But it is not known if Donovan took the phrase from there.

The record had a "Beatlesque" feel to it, and was sometimes mistaken for a Beatles song. Donovan, in fact, was friends with the Beatles. Paul McCartney can be heard as one of the background revellers on this track, but contrary to popular belief, it is not McCartney whispering the "quite rightly" answering lines in the chorus, but rather Donovan himself.  Donovan had a small part in coming up with the lyrics for "Yellow Submarine", and McCartney played bass guitar (uncredited) on portions of Donovan's Mellow Yellow album. 

In 2005, the track was remastered by EMI Records for the Mellow Yellow album re-issue. 

Covers and adaptations

"Mellow Yellow" was covered in 1967 by soul singer Big Maybelle on her album Got a Brand New Bag.  It was also covered in 1968 by British R&B singer/keyboardist Georgie Fame on his album The Third Face of Fame. 

In 1970, a Czech version of the song was issued by Czech singer and actor Václav Neckář on the Supraphon label. 

In 1999, "Mellow Yellow" was sung by a group of young adults, among whom were then-unknowns Alex Greenwald, Rashida Jones and Jason Thompson, in Gap's "Everybody in Cords" commercial directed by Pedro Romhanyi. The music mix was done by the Dust Brothers.  In 2015 the song was covered by Spanish singer Abraham Mateo for the soundtrack and promotion of the film Minions.  In Brazil Michel Teló covered the song, adapted to Portuguese, also for the movie. 

One of the oldest coffeeshops in Amsterdam is called "Mellow Yellow".

Passage:
She Walks in Beauty
"She Walks in Beauty" is a poem written in 1813 by Lord Byron, and is  one of his most famous works. It was one of several poems to be set to Jewish tunes from the synagogue by Isaac Nathan, which were published as Hebrew Melodies in 1815. 

It is said to have been inspired by an event in Byron's life; while at a ball, Byron met his cousin by marriage through John Wilmot. She was in mourning, wearing a black dress set with spangles, as in the opening lines;  He was struck by her unusual beauty, and the next morning the poem was written.  
The first two verses are cited in the novel The Philadelphian by Richard P. Powell.
Nathan, in his reminiscences of Byron, suggests (without any justification) that the subject of the poem may have been Byron's half-sister, Augusta Leigh.
Question:
"Who wrote the poem, which begins, ""She walks in beauty like the night. Of cloudless climes, and starry skies""?"

6th Lord Byron

Bette Nesmith Graham
Bette Nesmith Graham (March 23, 1924 – May 12, 1980) was an American typist, commercial artist, and the inventor of Liquid Paper.  She was also the mother of musician and producer Michael Nesmith of The Monkees.

Biography

Graham was born Bette Clair McMurray in Dallas, Texas to Jesse McMurray, an automotive supply company manager, and Christine Duval.  She was raised in San Antonio and graduated from Alamo Heights High School.  She married Warren Audrey Nesmith (1919–1984) before he left to fight in World War II. While he was overseas she had a child (Robert Michael Nesmith, born December 30, 1942). After Warren Nesmith returned home, they divorced (1946).
In the early 1950s, her father died, leaving some property in Dallas to Bette. She, her mother, Michael, and her sister Yvonne moved there. To support herself as a single mother, she worked as a secretary at Texas Bank and Trust. She eventually attained the position of the executive secretary, the highest position open at that time to women in the industry.

It was difficult to erase mistakes made by early electric typewriters, which caused problems. In order to make extra money she used her talent painting holiday windows at the bank. She realized, as she said, "with lettering, an artist never corrects by erasing, but always paints over the error. So I decided to use what artists use. I put some tempera water-based paint in a bottle and took my watercolor brush to the office. I used that to correct my mistakes."

Graham secretly used her white correction paint for five years, making some improvements with help from her son's chemistry teacher at Thomas Jefferson High School in Dallas. Some bosses admonished her against using it, but coworkers frequently sought her "paint out." She eventually began marketing her typewriter correction fluid as "Mistake Out" in 1956. The name was later changed to Liquid Paper when she began her own company.

Mistake Out started the 1960s operating at a small loss, with Nesmith's home doubling as company headquarters.  As the product became an indispensable tool of the secretarial trade, Nesmith relocated production and shipping from her kitchen to a 10x26-foot portable metal structure in her backyard, where packaging, shipping, and production were centered. 

In 1962 Bette Nesmith married Robert Graham, who joined her in running the company.  They divorced in 1975. 

In 1979 she sold Liquid Paper to the Gillette Corporation for USD $47.5 million. At the time, her company employed 200 people and made 25 million bottles of Liquid Paper per year. 

Bette Nesmith died May 12, 1980, at the age of 56, in Richardson, Texas. 

Management style

From the start, Graham ran her company with a unique combination of spirituality, egalitarianism, and pragmatism.  Raised a Methodist, Graham converted to Christian Science in 1942 and this faith inspired the development of her corporate "Statement of Policy." Part code of ethics, part business philosophy, it covered everything from her belief in a "Supreme Being" to a focus on decentralized decision making and an emphasis on product quality over profit motive.  She also believed that women could bring a more nurturing and humanistic quality to the male world of business, and did so herself by including a greenbelt with a fish pond, an employee library, and a childcare center in her new company headquarters in 1975. 

Legacy

Her only son Michael inherited half of his mother's $50+ million estate.  A portion financed the Gihon Foundation which established the Council on Ideas, a think tank with a retreat center located north of Santa Fe, New Mexico active from 1990 to 2000 and devoted to exploring world problems.

What popular office product/brand did Bette Nesmith Graham (mother of Monkee Mike Nesmith) invent and later sell to Gillette for nearly $50m in 1979?
Answer:
Liquid paper
Passage:
Braeburn
The 'Braeburn' is a cultivar of apple that is firm to the touch with a red/orange vertical streaky appearance on a yellow/green background. Its color intensity varies with different growing conditions.

It was discovered as a chance seedling in 1952 by the farmer O. Moran from Waiwhero in the Moutere Hills near Motueka, New Zealand. It was then cultivated by the Williams Brothers nursery as a potential export variety. It is thought to be a cross between Granny Smith and Lady Hamilton.  The apple itself is named after Braeburn Orchard where it was first commercially grown.

Braeburn apples have a combination of sweet and tart flavour. They are available October through April in the northern hemisphere  and are medium to large in size. They are a popular fruit for growers because of their ability to store well when chilled. 

Braeburn apples are useful in cooking in that they hold their shape and do not release a great deal of liquid making them ideal for tarts.  According to the US Apple Association website it is one of the fifteen most popular apple cultivars in the United States. 

Braeburn Browning Disorder 

Apples can be preserved by short, medium or long-term
storage. Braeburn can turn brown inside during commercial long term storage, and it’s usually not possible to tell if an apple has the Braeburn browning disorder until a person bites or cuts into it.  Apples respond dramatically to both temperature and atmosphere modification. Rapid temperature reduction and the exacting maintenance of low temperature close to the chilling point of the variety can provide good to medium quality product following 3 to 6 mo of storage and in some cases longer. However, modern commercial warehouses couple
temperature management with controlled atmosphere (CA) for long-term storage of apples. Braeburn can be stored at 0 °C in air for 3–4 months, and in CA for 8–10 months, with only a slight susceptibility to scalding although it is sensitive to carbon dioxide.  The variety has a relatively impermeable skin, which restricts diffusion of gases into and out of the fruit, leading to high internal carbon dioxide concentrations. 

The browning disorder seems worse in overmature fruit, fruit from lightly cropped trees, and large fruit, but it can show up on different trees in different years, and in some regions, but not others.

Maintaining the superior qualities of Braeburn while eliminating Braeburn browning disorder led to development of the Jazz cultivar. Since Braeburn is such a desirable variety, commercial orchards and trees in regions and locations that have proven not susceptible to the browning disorder are being maintained. Since most home orchardists do not attempt very long term storage, they do not encounter the browning disorder.

I Feel Love
"I Feel Love" is a 1977 song by American singer-songwriter Donna Summer from her fifth studio album I Remember Yesterday. It peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Outside the United States, "I Feel Love" topped the charts in Australia and the United Kingdom and peaked within the top ten of the charts in Canada and New Zealand. Giorgio Moroder, the song's producer, was an early adopter of electronic sequencers and four-four beats. The song became popular in High Energy discos,  while earlier disco hits were based on soft string and assuring female vocals, "I Feel Love" is formed on a hard kick drum and progressive bass lines seminal in the development of modern electronic dance music.

Production

Before "I Feel Love", most disco recordings had been backed by acoustic orchestras although all-electronic music had been produced for decades.  Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte's innovative production of this disco-style song, recorded with an entirely synthesized backing track, utilizing a Moog synthesizer, spawned imitators in the disco genre, and was influential in the development of techno. Moroder went to work on the song with Bellotte in his Musicland studio in Munich. "We wanted to conclude with a futuristic song," he said, "and I decided that it had to be done with a synthesizer." 

Unusually for a disco track of that era, Moroder composed the backing track and bass line before the melody. He introduced a degree of variety by altering the song's key at regular intervals and layering in Summer's repetitive and synthesized vocals. 

Critical reception

The song would garner Summer her first American Music Award nomination for Favourite Female Soul/R & B Artist.                                                                                                                                                  
According to David Bowie, then in the middle of recording of his Berlin Trilogy with Brian Eno, its impact on the genre's direction was recognized early on:

Music critic Vince Aletti wrote that, "The pace is fierce and utterly gripping with the synthesizer effects particularly aggressive and emotionally charged." He went on to predict that the track "should easily equal if not surpass" the success of "Love to Love You Baby" in the clubs. 

The album version lasts for almost six minutes. It was extended for release as a 12" maxi-single,  the eight-minute version included on the 1989 compilation The Dance Collection: A Compilation of Twelve Inch Singles. The song was slightly edited on the 7" format, the fade-in opening sound reaching maximum volume sooner. A version which fades out at 3:45, before the third verse and final choruses, has been included on a large number of greatest hits packages and other compilations issued by PolyGram, Mercury Records, Universal Music and others, such as 1994's Endless Summer: Greatest Hits and 2003's The Journey: The Very Best of Donna Summer.

Following the track's success, Summer, Moroder and Bellotte produced the 11-minute "Now I Need You"/"Working the Midnight Shift" sequence on Summer's 1977 double album Once Upon a Time, which successfully builds on "I Feel Love"'s pioneering ethereal vocals, mechanised beats, sequenced arpeggios and ostinato basslines.

Commercial performance

The song peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 chart the week of  November 12, 1977. It reached number nine on the Soul Singles Chart in October 1977. Its 1995 remix peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play.

In the United Kingdom, "I Feel Love" peaked at the top of the UK Singles Chart in July 1977, a position it maintained for four weeks. It also top the charts in Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, Italy and the Netherlands; and peaked within the top ten in Canada, Ireland, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden and Switzerland.   The 1982 and 1995 remixes of the song peaked at number 21 and number eight on the chart respectively, and sales of these physical singles totalled 956,400.  According to the Official Charts Company, together with digital sales, "I Feel Love" has sold 1.07 million copies in Britain as of June 2013, making it the country's 103rd best-selling single of all time.

Patrick Cowley remix

In 1978, disco and hi-NRG DJ Patrick Cowley created a 15:43 remix of "I Feel Love" which, despite not impressing Moroder, became a popular "underground classic" available only on acetate discs. The remix used loops, keeping the song's bass-line going for extended passages of overdubbed effects and synthesiser parts.

In mid-1980, Cowley's mix was released with the title "I Feel Love / I Feel Megalove" and subtitle "The Patrick Cowley MegaMix", but only on a limited vinyl pressing by the DJ-only subscription service Disconet. Since this pressing was not available to the general public for commercial sale, it became highly sought after by collectors.

In 1982 the mix was released on a commercially available 12" single in the UK market by Casablanca, backed with an 8-minute edited version. With this wider release, "I Feel Love" became a dance floor hit again, five years after its debut. A further-edited 7" single reached number 21 on the UK singles chart.

The Patrick Cowley mix was out of print until it was released on the bonus disc of the UK edition of The Journey: The Very Best of Donna Summer; it also exists on the 2013 double disc I Feel Love: The Collection.

1995 remixes

Following 1993's The Donna Summer Anthology and 1994's Endless Summer: Greatest Hits, both released by PolyGram, "I Feel Love" was re-released on the PolyGram sublabel Manifesto in a newly remixed form as a single in 1995, including mixes by Masters At Work and Rollo Armstrong and Sister Bliss of UK remixer/producer team Faithless – and also new vocals by Summer herself. The single became a UK number 8 hit, the second time the song had entered the Top 10, and the '95 Radio Edit was later included as a bonus track on PolyGram France's version of the Endless Summer compilation.

Passage:
Eddystone Rocks
The Eddystone, or the Eddystone Rocks, are a seaswept and heavily eroded group of rocks situated some 9 statute miles (14 kilometres) south west of Rame Head in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. Formerly a treacherous hazard for ships in the approaches to the English Channel and the port city of Plymouth, the rocks have played host to four iterations of the Eddystone Lighthouse, and are still home to the current lighthouse and the stub of its immediate predecessor. View at 1:50000 scale.

Although the nearest point on the mainland to the Eddystone is in Cornwall, the rocks fall within the city limits of Plymouth, and hence within the county of Devon.

There have been four lighthouses on the Eddystone Rocks. Winstanley (two versions; the second however just replaced the top of the structure), Rudyard, Smeaton and finally the Douglass Lighthouse, which is the present one. When the Douglass Lighthouse was completed the people of Plymouth, grateful for the countless lives which had been saved since the introduction of the lighthouses, paid for the dismantling of the Smeaton Lighthouse from the red rocks of Eddystone  and reassembly at Plymouth Hoe, where it is a popular tourist attraction today.

A traditional sea-shanty "The Eddystone Light" chronicles a fictional encounter between the lighthouse keeper and a mermaid. The Seekers, the Weavers, and Peter, Paul and Mary have recorded the shanty.

Geology 

Eddystone rock is something of an anomaly in the geology of the South West region; it is composed of garnetiferous gneissic rock which is part of a considerable underwater outcrop of mica-schists and granitoid gneisses which have not been found elsewhere in South West England.

Isotopic ages suggest that the last period of deformation was during the end of the Devonian, but their highly metamorphosed state indicates they likely have an older ancestry, a relic of earlier tectonic activity, probably of  Precambrian age.

Passage:
Pillars of Hercules
The Pillars of Hercules (, , , ) was the phrase that was applied in Antiquity to the promontories that flank the entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar. The northern Pillar is the Rock of Gibraltar (part of the British overseas territory of Gibraltar). A corresponding North African peak not being predominant, the identity of the southern Pillar has been disputed throughout history,  with the two most likely candidates being Monte Hacho in Ceuta and Jebel Musa in Morocco.

History

According to Greek mythology adopted by the Etruscans and Romans, when Hercules had to perform twelve labours, one of them (the tenth) was to fetch the Cattle of Geryon of the far West and bring them to Eurystheus; this marked the westward extent of his travels. A lost passage of Pindar quoted by Strabo was the earliest traceable reference in this context: "the pillars which Pindar calls the 'gates of Gades' when he asserts that they are the farthermost limits reached by Heracles."  Since there has been a one-to-one association between Heracles and Melqart since Herodotus, the "Pillars of Melqart" in the temple near Gades/Gádeira (modern Cádiz) have sometimes been considered to be the true Pillars of Hercules. 

According to Plato's account, the lost realm of Atlantis was situated beyond the Pillars of Hercules, in effect placing it in the realm of the Unknown. Renaissance tradition says the pillars bore the warning Nec plus ultra (also Non plus ultra, "nothing further beyond"), serving as a warning to sailors and navigators to go no further.

According to some Roman sources,  while on his way to the garden of the Hesperides on the island of Erytheia, Hercules had to cross the mountain that was once Atlas. Instead of climbing the great mountain, Hercules used his superhuman strength to smash through it. By doing so, he connected the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and formed the Strait of Gibraltar. One part of the split mountain is Gibraltar and the other is either Monte Hacho or Jebel Musa. These two mountains taken together have since then been known as the Pillars of Hercules, though other natural features have been associated with the name.  Diodorus Siculus,  however, held that instead of smashing through an isthmus to create the Straits of Gibraltar, Hercules narrowed an already existing strait to prevent monsters from the Atlantic Ocean from entering the Mediterranean Sea.

Pillars as a portal

File:Columnas Plus Ultra.png|Device of Charles V in Seville's city hall.
File:Pillars of Hercules.svg|The columns as depicted in the Spanish coat of arms.

The Pillars appear as supporters of the coat of arms of Spain, originating in the  impresa of Spain's sixteenth century king Charles I, who was also the Holy Roman Emperor as Charles V. It bears the motto Plus Ultra, Latin for further beyond, implying that the pillars were a gateway.

Phoenician connection

Beyond Gades, several important Mauritanian colonies (in modern-day Morocco) were founded by the Phoenicians as the Phoenician merchant navy pushed through the Pillars of Hercules and began constructing a series of bases along the Atlantic coast starting with Lixus in the north, then Chellah and finally Mogador. 

Near the eastern shore of the island of Gades/Gadeira (modern Cádiz, just beyond the strait) Strabo describes  the westernmost temple of Tyrian Heracles, the god with whom Greeks associated the Phoenician and Punic Melqart, by interpretatio graeca. Strabo notes  that the two bronze pillars within the temple, each eight cubits high, were widely proclaimed to be the true Pillars of Hercules by many who had visited the place and had sacrificed to Heracles there. But Strabo believes the account to be fraudulent, in part noting that the inscriptions on those pillars mentioned nothing about Heracles, speaking only of the expenses incurred by the Phoenicians in their making.  The columns of the Melqart temple at Tyre were also of religious significance.

The Pillars in Syriac geography

Syriac scholars were aware of the Pillars through their efforts to translate Greek scientific works into their language as well as into Arabic. The Syriac compendium of knowledge known as Ktaba d'ellat koll 'ellan. "The Cause of all Causes", is unusual in asserting that there were three, not two, columns 

Dante's Inferno

In Inferno XXVI Dante Alighieri mentions Ulysses in the pit of the Fraudulent Counsellors and his voyage past the Pillars of Hercules. Ulysses justifies endangering his sailors by the fact that his goal is to gain knowledge of the unknown. After five months of navigation in the ocean, Ulysses sights the mountain of Purgatory but encounters a whirlwind from it that sinks his ship and all on it for their daring to approach Purgatory while alive, by their strength and wits alone.

Sir Francis Bacon's Novum Organum

The Pillars appear prominently on the engraved title page of Sir Francis Bacon's Instauratio Magna ("Great Renewal"), 1620, an unfinished work of which the second part was his influential Novum Organum. The motto along the base says Multi pertransibunt et augebitur scientia ("Many will pass through and knowledge will be the greater").  The image was based on the use of the pillars in Spanish and Habsburg propaganda.

In architecture

On the Spanish coast at Los Barrios are Torres de Hercules which are twin towers that were inspired by the Pillars of Hercules. These towers are the tallest buildings in Andalucía.

Passage:
Judith Rossner
Judith Perelman Rossner (March 31, 1935 – August 9, 2005) was an American novelist, best known for her 1975 novel Looking for Mr. Goodbar. It was inspired by the murder of Roseann Quinn and examined the underside of the 1970s sexual liberation movement.  This was her bestselling work, and it was adapted as a film of the same name, starring Diane Keaton.  Rossner published other novels, set in both contemporary and historical times. Her most successful post-Goodbar novel was 1983's August, about the relationship between a troubled young woman in New York and her psychoanalyst with emotional troubles of her own.

Life

Judith Perelman was born on March 31, 1935 in New York City into a Jewish family.  Her mother was a schoolteacher and her father was a textile worker. Perelman was raised in the Bronx. Her mother committed suicide and her father was alcoholic.[http://www.nysun.com/obituaries/judith-rossner-70-novelist-of-mr-goodbar/18467/ Judith Rossner, 70, Novelist of 'Mr. Goodbar' - August 11, 2005 - The New York Sun] Perelman attended public schools.

She dropped out of the City College of New York to marry Robert Rossner, a teacher and writer. He is best known as a mystery novelist under the pen name Ivan T. Ross. The couple had two children, Daniel and Jean, and later divorced. Judith Rossner married twice more. She had no other children.

Judith Rossner worked as a secretary in a real estate business to support herself. She also wrote short stories and tried to sell them to women's magazines, but was unsuccessful.

Rossner's first novel, To The Precipice, was published in 1966. It and her other two early books received excellent reviews but they were not commercially successful. 

Soon after leaving her first husband, Rossner wrote Any Minute I Can Split (1972), about a pregnant woman who runs away to a commune. Based on this, Esquire magazine asked Rossner to write a story for them. She suggested the real-life account of Roseann Quinn, a young schoolteacher who was brutally murdered in 1973 by a man she reportedly met at a singles club. Rossner wrote the story but said Esquire lawyers killed the article because they were concerned that its publication would affect the pending trial of the murder suspect. 

Rossner decided to write a novel to explore these events more deeply. It was published as Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1975). She captured some of the myths and social times as women explored sexual freedom, and studied women's passivity. The book brought her fame and wealth, allowing Rossner to quit her day job and focus full-time on writing. "Goodbar" was adapted as a successful and controversial Hollywood film, released in 1977; it featured Diane Keaton, William Atherton, Tuesday Weld, Richard Kiley and Richard Gere. The film was directed by Richard Brooks. 

In 1977, Rossner published Attachments, a story about a pair of friends who marry conjoined twins. This was followed by Emmeline (1980), based on an historic Maine woman. It is the story of a fourteen-year-old farm girl who gets a factory job in Lowell, Massachusetts, to support her impoverished family. She is seduced, becomes pregnant, and loses her job. She must give the child up for adoption. Two decades later, she marries a younger man, learning only later that he is her son. Her secret revealed, she is ostracized by her town.  The book was adapted as an opera, with music by American composer Tobias Picker and libretto by poet JD McClatchy. It premiered in 1996 at the Santa Fe Opera, and has been produced several times by other companies. 

August, Rossner's most successful novel following 'Mr. Goodbar', was published in 1983 to critical acclaim. After this novel's publication, Rossner became seriously ill with viral meningitis. She suffered memory loss and contracted diabetes, becoming unable to write for many years. Writing again, she published His Little Women in 1990 to universally poor reviews. Olivia (1994) followed. Rossner published her last novel, Perfidia, in 1997.

Rossner died on August 9, 2005 at the age of seventy at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan.  She was survived by her third husband, Stanley Leff, her two children, and three grandchildren.
