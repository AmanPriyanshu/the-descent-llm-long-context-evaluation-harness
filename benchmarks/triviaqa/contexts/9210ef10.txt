Passage:
Tomorrow Is Another Day (1951 film)
Tomorrow Is Another Day is a 1951 crime drama film noir directed by Felix E. Feist, starring Ruth Roman and Steve Cochran.  An ex-convict who thinks he killed a man goes into hiding with a woman whose boyfriend is the supposed murder victim.  The title of the film comes from the last line of Gone with the Wind.

Plot

Convicted of murder at age 13, Bill Clark is freed after 18 years behind bars. He meets a taxi dancer, Catherine Higgins, but when her New York City police detective boyfriend George Conover catches them together, Bill is knocked out. When he awakens, Conover has been shot.

Bill knows the cops will come after him. He doesn't realize Catherine's the one who shot her boyfriend. She volunteers to go with him and they hitch-hike to California, falling in love along the way. They accompany the Dawson family to the lettuce fields of Salinas, where they find honest work and happiness, changing their identities.

A reporter's article about Clark is found by the Dawsons, who need money badly and turn in Bill for a reward. But back in New York, police reveal that before Conover died, he confessed that Catherine shot him in self-defense. She and Bill are cleared to resume their lives.

Cast

* Ruth Roman as Catherine "Cay" Higgins
* Steve Cochran as Bill Clark / Mike Lewis

Reception

Critical response

Film critic Dennis Schwartz seemed disappointed with the film, writing "Gloomy minor film noir with a happy ending. The movie was made for John Garfield, but he died in 1951. A satisfactory Steve Cochran takes the part and gives it his best shot. Competently directed by Felix Feist (The Devil Thumbs a Ride/The Threat/Donovan's Brain), as always, and adequately written by Guy Endore (blacklisted after the movie for his political activism) and Art Cohn. Though watchable, the social conscious film remains forgettable--unable to leave a particularly sympathetic lasting impression of its outsider characters, whose distrust of the authorities leads them to be anti-social types and humorless downers for most of the pic."

Petrology
Petrology (from the Greek πέτρος, pétros, "rock" and λόγος, lógos, "subject matter", see -logy) is the branch of geology that studies the origin, composition, distribution and structure of rocks.

Lithology was once approximately synonymous with petrography, but in current usage, lithology focuses on macroscopic hand-sample or outcrop-scale description of rocks while petrography is the speciality that deals with microscopic details.

In the petroleum industry, lithology, or more specifically mud logging, is the graphic representation of geological formations being drilled through, and drawn on a log called a mud log. As the cuttings are circulated out of the borehole they are sampled, examined (typically under a 10× microscope) and tested chemically when needed.

Methodology

Petrology utilizes the fields of mineralogy, petrography, optical mineralogy, and chemical analysis to describe the composition and texture of rocks. Petrologists also include the principles of geochemistry and geophysics through the study of geochemical trends and cycles and the use of thermodynamic data and experiments in order to better understand the origins of rocks.

Branches 

There are three branches of petrology, corresponding to the three types of rocks: igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary, and another dealing with experimental techniques:

*Igneous petrology focuses on the composition and texture of igneous rocks (rocks such as granite or basalt which have crystallized from molten rock or magma). Igneous rocks include volcanic and plutonic rocks.
*Sedimentary petrology focuses on the composition and texture of sedimentary rocks (rocks such as sandstone, shale, or limestone which consist of pieces or particles derived from other rocks or biological or chemical deposits, and are usually bound together in a matrix of finer material).
*Metamorphic petrology focuses on the composition and texture of metamorphic rocks (rocks such as slate, marble, gneiss, or schist which started out as sedimentary or igneous rocks but which have undergone chemical, mineralogical or textural changes due to extremes of pressure, temperature or both)
*Experimental petrology employs high-pressure, high-temperature apparatus to investigate the geochemistry and phase relations of natural or synthetic materials at elevated pressures and temperatures. Experiments are particularly useful for investigating rocks of the lower crust and upper mantle that rarely survive the journey to the surface in pristine condition. They are also one of the prime sources of information about completely inaccessible rocks such as those in the Earth's lower mantle and in the mantles of the other terrestrial planets and the Moon. The work of experimental petrologists has laid a foundation on which modern understanding of igneous and metamorphic processes has been built.

'Petrology' is the study of the origin, structure and composition of what?

Holy city
Holy city is a term applied to many cities, all of them central to the history or faith of specific religions. Such cities may also contain at least one headquarters complex (often containing a religious edifice, seminary, shrine, residence of the leading cleric of the religion and/or chambers of the religious leadership's offices) which constitutes a major destination of human traffic, or pilgrimage to the city, especially for major ceremonies and observances.

Passage:
Tommy Johnson (musician)
Tommy Johnson (1896 – November 1, 1956) was an influential American Delta blues musician who recorded in the late 1920s and was known for his eerie falsetto voice and intricate guitar playing. 

Early life

Johnson was born near Terry, Mississippi, and moved around 1910 to Crystal Springs, where he lived for most of his life. 
He learned to play the guitar and, by 1914, was supplementing his income by playing at local parties with his brothers Major and LeDell. In 1916 he married and moved to Webb Jennings' plantation near Drew, Mississippi, close to the Dockery Plantation. There he met other musicians, including Charlie Patton and Willie Brown.[http://www.nps.gov/history/delta/blues/people/tommy_johnson.htm ] 

Career

By 1920 Johnson was an alcoholic and an itinerant musician, based in Crystal Springs but traveling widely around the South, sometimes accompanied by Papa Charlie McCoy. In 1928 he made his first recordings, with McCoy, for Victor Records, including "Canned Heat Blues", in which he sang of drinking methanol from the cooking fuel Sterno. The song features the refrain "canned heat, mama, sure, Lord, killing me." The blues group Canned Heat took their name from this song. Johnson's "Big Road Blues" inspired Canned Heat's song "On the Road Again". A significantly different version of the song appears as "Canned Heat" on the album Big Road Blues by K. C. Douglas.

Johnson recorded two further sessions, for Victor in August 1928 and for Paramount Records in December 1929. He did not record again, mistakenly believing that he had signed away his right to record. Some suggest he had been intentionally given this misimpression by people at Paramount Records. This resulted in a legal settlement with the Mississippi Sheiks, who had used the melody of Johnson's "Big Road Blues" in their successful "Stop and Listen". Johnson was party to the copyright settlement but was too drunk at the time to understand what he had signed. 

Johnson's recordings established him as the premier Delta blues vocalist of his day, with a powerful voice that could go from a growl to a falsetto. He was an accomplished guitarist. He also performed tricks with his guitar, playing it between his legs and behind his head and throwing it in the air while playing.

His style influenced later blues singers, such as Robert Nighthawk and Howlin' Wolf (whose song "I Asked for Water [She Brought Me Gasoline]" was based on Johnson's "Cool Water Blues"), and the country singer Hank Williams. Johnson was a talented composer, blending fragments of folk poetry and personalized lyrics into set guitar accompaniments to craft striking blues compositions such as "Maggie Campbell". 

To enhance his fame, Johnson cultivated a sinister persona. According to his brother LeDell, he claimed to have sold his soul to the devil at a crossroads in exchange for his mastery of the guitar.Evans, David (1971). Tommy Johnson. Studio Vista. p. 22. ISBN 978-0289701515. This story was later also associated with Robert Johnson, to whom Tommy Johnson was unrelated.

Johnson remained a popular performer in the Jackson area through the 1930s and 1940s, sometimes performing with Ishman Bracey. He influenced other performers, partly because he was willing to teach his style and his repertoire. His influence on local traditions is described by David Evans in Tommy Johnson and Big Road Blues: Tradition and Creativity in the Folk Blues. 

Death

Johnson died of a heart attack after playing at a party in 1956. He is buried in the Warm Springs Methodist Church Cemetery, outside Crystal Springs, Mississippi. In 2001 his family commissioned a headstone through the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund, a Mississippi nonprofit corporation; it was paid for by the musician Bonnie Raitt. The large granite memorial, engraved with Johnson's portrait, was not placed on his grave for several years afterward, however, because of a dispute between Johnson's family (led by his niece, Vera Johnson Collins), the owners of farm property encircling the cemetery, and the Copiah County Board of Supervisors over a deteriorated road to the burial site. The dispute was resolved in October 2012, when it was announced that the headstone would be erected on October 26.  The headstone had been on public display in the Crystal Springs Public Library since being unveiled on October 20, 2001. On the night of Saturday, February 2, 2013, the headstone was desecrated, apparently smashed by a sledge hammer or some similar device. 

An annual Tommy Johnson Blues Festival is held in Crystal Springs on the third weekend in October. The inaugural festival was held in Jackson and Crystal Springs in 2006. 

In fiction

In the film O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), a character named Tommy Johnson, played by Chris Thomas King, describes selling his soul to the devil to play guitar. The Tommy Johnson character in the film plays a number of songs originally recorded by the blues musician Skip James and accompanies the Soggy Bottom Boys, a band consisting of the film's three main protagonists plus Johnson, on "Man of Constant Sorrow".

The story of Johnson's selling his soul to the devil was first told by his brother, LaDell Johnson, and reported by David Evans in his 1971 biography of Johnson. This legend was subsequently attributed to the blues musician Robert Johnson.

Question:
Which Californian blues-influenced boogie rock band of the 1960's took their name from the title of a Tommy Johnson blues hit of 1928 that told the story of an alcoholic who had desperately turned to drinking cooking fuel?
Answer:
'CANNED HEAT'
Passage:
Fathom
A fathom is a unit of length in the imperial and the U.S. customary systems equal to 6 feet (1.8288 metres), used especially for measuring the depth of water.

There are two yards (6 feet) in an imperial fathom.Encyclopædia Britannica eleventh edition 1911. Originally based on the distance between a man's outstretched arms, the size of a fathom has varied slightly depending on whether it was defined as a thousandth of an (Admiralty) nautical mile or as a multiple of the imperial yard.  Formerly, the term was used for any of several units of length varying around 5 -.

The name derives from the Old English word fæðm, corresponding to the Old High German word "fadum" meaning embracing arms or a pair of outstretched arms.Oxford English Dictionary, second edition, 1989;    In Middle English it was fathme.
A cable length, based on the length of a ship's cable, has been variously reckoned as equal to 100 or 120 fathoms. At one time, a quarter meant one-fourth of a fathom.

International fathom 

One  fathom is equal to:
* 1.8288 metres exactly (1 metre is about 0.5468 fathoms) 
* 2 yards (1 yard is exactly 1/2 of a fathom)
* 6 feet (1 foot is exactly 1/6 of a fathom)
* 18 hands
* 72 inches

In the international yard and pound agreement of 1959 the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom defined the length of the international yard to be exactly 0.9144 metre. With the adoption of the metric SI system the use of fathoms declined.

British fathom

The British Admiralty defined a fathom to be a thousandth of an imperial nautical mile (which was 6080 ft) or . In practice the "warship fathom" of exactly 6 ft was used in Britain and the United States. No conflict in the real world existed as depths on Imperial nautical charts were indicated in feet if less than 30 ft and in fathoms for depths above that. Until the 19th century in England, the length of the fathom was more variable: from 5½ feet on merchant vessels to either 5 ft or 7 ft on fishing vessels (from ).Fenna (2000: 88-89)

Use of the fathom

Water depth

Most modern nautical charts indicate depth in metres. However, the U.S. Hydrographic Office uses feet and fathoms.  A nautical chart will always explicitly indicate the units of depth used.

To measure the depth of shallow waters, boatmen used a sounding line containing fathom points, some marked and others in between, called deeps, unmarked but estimated by the user.  Water near the coast and not too deep to be fathomed by a hand sounding line was referred to as in soundings or on soundings.  The area offshore beyond the 100 fathom line, too deep to be fathomed by a hand sounding line, was referred to as out of soundings or off soundings.  A deep-sea lead, the heaviest of sounding leads, was used in water exceeding 100 fathoms in depth. 

This technique has been superseded by sonic depth finders for measuring mechanically the depth of water beneath a ship, one version of which is the Fathometer (trademark).  The record made by such a device is a fathogram.  A fathom line or fathom curve, a usually sinuous line on a nautical chart, joins all points having the same depth of water, thereby indicating the contour of the ocean floor. 

Line length

The components of a commercial fisherman's setline were measured in fathoms. The rope called a groundline, used to form the main line of a setline, was usually provided in bundles of 300 fathoms. A single 50-fathom skein (300 ft) of this rope was referred to as a line. Especially in Pacific coast fisheries the setline was composed of units called "skates", each consisting of several hundred fathoms of groundline, with gangions and hooks attached. A tuck seine or tuck net about 70 fathoms long (420 ft), and very deep in the middle, was used to take fish from a larger seine.

A line attached to a whaling harpoon was about 150 fathoms long (900 ft). A forerunner — a piece of cloth tied on a ship's log line some fathoms from the outboard end — marked the limit of drift line. A kite was a drag, towed under water at any depth up to about 40 fathoms, which upon striking bottom, was upset and rose to the surface.

A shot, one of the forged lengths of chain joined by shackles to form an anchor cable, was usually 15 fathoms long (90 ft). 

A shackle, a length of cable or chain equal to 12.5 fathoms or 75 feet.  In 1949, the British navy redefined the shackle to be 15 fathoms.

In Finland, fathom (syli) is sometimes, albeit seldom, used as a maritime unit,  of a nautical mile and  of cable length.

Burial

It is customary, when burying the dead, to inter the corpse at a fathom's depth, or six feet under. A burial at sea (where the body is weighted to force it to the bottom) requires a minimum of six fathoms of water. This is the origin of the phrase "to deep six" as meaning to discard, or dispose of. 

A similar sentiment is expressed in The Tempest, where a character is told "Full fathom five thy father lies".

On land

Until early in the 20th century, it was the unit used to measure the depth of mines (mineral extraction) in the United Kingdom.  Miners also use it as a unit of area equal to 6 sqft in the plane of a vein. In Britain, it can mean the quantity of wood in a pile of any length measuring 6 ft square in cross section. 
In Hungary square fathom ("négyszögöl") is still in use as an unofficial measure of land area, primarily for small lots suitable for construction.

Former Nazi guard, 89, faces mass murder trial — RT News
Former Nazi guard, 89, faces mass murder trial — RT News
Tags Crime , Hate crimes
Demjanjuk will be tried for assisting in the killing of Jews at the Sobibor extermination camp in Poland during World War Two.
The U.S. Court of Appeal dismissed the 89-year-old’s claims that moving him to Germany would amount to torture because of his poor health.
"Based on the medical information before the court … the court cannot find that the petitioner's removal to Germany is likely to cause irreparable harm sufficient to warrant a stay of removal," the court announced.
Prosecutors said that Demjanjuk’s torture arguments sound ridiculous as there are medical assessments and videos showing him to be in good health and able to walk without help.
Demjanjuk’s family is considering an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. It has also filed a lawsuit in Germany to prevent his extradition.
"Given the history of this case and no evidence of his personal involvement in even one assault, let alone a murder, this is inhuman, even if a court says it is lawful," Demjanjuk’s son John Demjanjuk was quoted by the AFP news agency as saying.
Demjanjuk was a Soviet Red Army soldier when he was captured by the Nazis in 1942.
After being trained by the Germans at Treblinka, he served two years in the camps of Sobibor and Majdanek in Nazi-occupied Poland and then in Flossenburg in Bavaria, Germany.
He emigrated to the USA in 1952 with his family and settled in Ohio, changing his name from Ivan to John.
Demjanjuk was deported to Israel from the US and sentenced to death in 1988, accused of being a sadistic Nazi guard nicknamed "Ivan the Terrible". But Israel's highest court later ruled that he was not the man in question.
After spending years in an Israeli prison, he returned to his home near Cleveland in 1993 and his citizenship was restored in 1998.
U.S. Justice Department Nazi hunters reopened the case when new evidence came to light after the collapse of the Soviet Union. And a U.S. court convicted him in 2002 of working at three other camps.
Demjanjuk was stripped of his citizenship a second time. Then German prosecutors began efforts to put him on trial.
Despite all the accusations, Demjanjuk maintains that he was forced to work in the camps. He says holocaust survivors have mistaken him for other, cruel camp guards.
Question:
Who was deported from the US aged 89 to face a war crime trial in Germany?
Answer:
John Demjanuk
Passage:
Nick Stone (character)
Nick Stone is the main fictional character in a series of books written by Andy McNab, who is an ex-member of British Army regiment the SAS. Andy McNab has written about Nick Stone in seventeen different books. Nick has undertaken many missions including kidnapping a powerful Russian Mafia lord and killing a money-laundering Algerian business man.

Nick Stone left the SAS in 1988, soon after the shooting of three IRA volunteers in Gibraltar. Once working for British Intelligence as a 'K' on deniable operations, he also briefly worked for an American agency. Now he roams the world as somewhat of a mercenary just trying to keep his head above water. Early novels are accounts of assassination and intrigue filled with tradecraft and detail. Later novels, while still detailed, deal with more social topics such as White slavery/prostitution, government corruption, war profiteering, Human rights and torture with Nick never having answers to these complicated topics, but normally just bearing witness.

Biography

Nick Stone's story is depicted as a traumatic one. He grew up in England with parents who he feels did not care about him. They hardly ever spent family time together, and they never did anything to make his childhood happy. His father is also suggested to have been a very violent man, and certain passages hint that Nick was a victim of child abuse at his hand (one passage says that his father locked him in the garden shed on a stormy night and left him there, in the dark and on his own, until the morning). Another says that his stepfather used to beat him, just because he liked to do it. His mother did nothing to stop this abuse, Stone stating that all she did was let it happen, then give him a Mars Bar afterwards. Nick treated his home as a waiting room until he could leave and, when he finally did, he signed up to the Army, eventually being recruited into the SAS. The characters' name and early years were allegedly based on those of a teenage acquaintance of McNab last known working a postman in Dartford.

In Remote Control he is asked if he is still married to which he replies 'no I divorced her', she is also mentioned in subsequent novels as a gauge on women's effect on him, such as references in Crisis Four where his newfound love for fellow operative Sarah is listed on his file at MI6 for the reason he divorced his wife.

After the murder of a fellow SAS soldier and his family, Nick becomes the sole guardian of their seven-year-old daughter Kelly, and the two went on the run from unidentified pursuers, unaware of who was the real target. In Dark Winter, Stone unearths a doomsday threat against the populations of New York, London and Berlin and finds himself facing an unspeakable trade-off; the life of someone he loves, against those of millions he doesn't even know.

In 1987, Stone was involved with a mission in Gibraltar to prevent three PIRA members from detonating a bomb there. This mission involving Stone is a reenactment of the actual event, Operation Flavius. This ended with the shooting in public of all three PIRA officials. This event drove Nick to retire from the SAS at some point between then and 1995. He says in Aggressor that his last job with the Regiment was supervising and being actively involved in the infamous Waco siege in 1993, he also refers to carrying out operations in the Gulf War in some of his books, mirroring Andy McNab's own SAS career. It seems he was being used for unofficial jobs by British Intelligence as early as 1995, as the character Sarah in Crisis Four encouraged him to approach them

He has had many chapters in his life and led a path that has taken him all over the world (including The Congo, Bosnia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Southern France, Ireland, Ulster, Switzerland, Malaysia, Georgia, Great Britain, the USA, Syria, Algeria, Libya, Italy, Dubai, Russia, Gibraltar, Finland, Moldova and Denmark), mostly under order of "The Firm" but others out of pure bad luck or personal quests for revenge or escapism.

Passage:
Ricky Wilson (singer)
Charles Richard "Ricky" Wilson (born 17 January 1978) is an English singer-songwriter. He is known as the lead singer of Kaiser Chiefs, a five-piece band from Menston and Guiseley in Leeds, West Yorkshire. Their successful songs include "Ruby", "I Predict a Riot", "Never Miss a Beat", "Oh My God", "Everyday I Love You Less and Less", and "Coming Home".

Before the formation of the Kaiser Chiefs in 2003, Wilson was a member of the band Runston Parva (later known as Parva) which consisted of members of Kaiser Chiefs.

On 19 September 2013, Wilson was confirmed as a coach on The Voice UK. He was the winning coach for both the fourth and fifth series of the show, being the only coach to win two years consecutively. It was announced that the fifth series would be his last in late 2015.

Life and career

Wilson was born in Keighley, West Yorkshire. He attended Leeds Grammar School after Ghyll Royd primary school. He later attended Leeds Metropolitan University and completed his BA (Hons) degree in Graphic Arts and Design in 2000.  He then taught at Leeds College of Art for a year before the band's big break. 

During the early days of Kaiser Chiefs, Wilson was well known for wearing stripy blazers, waistcoats, turn-up jeans, and winkle picker shoes, a style that won him the Shockwaves NME Award For Best Dressed Person in 2006.  Lately, he has adopted a more casual dress code.

Wilson is well known for his energetic stage presence, climbing scaffolding, standing on the safety barrier, and at times crowd surfing. Of crowd surfing, Wilson says he likes to "get out and see the crowd, see what they smell like".  Such exploits have occasionally resulted in injury, such as torn ankle ligaments after jumping off stage during a concert in Portugal. 

In May 2006, Wilson was involved in a hit-and-run accident in his home town of Leeds. He was hit by the car while attempting to walk over a pedestrian crossing, suffering only bruising and a broken toe owing to a 'Ricky trademark jump' which resulted in him hitting the windscreen and being flipped over the top of the vehicle rather than trapped underneath. 

Other works

Wilson has twice been a guest on the BBC Two television show, Never Mind the Buzzcocks, firstly in 2005 as a panellist and then as a guest host in 2006. He also featured on the panel of the BBC Television comedy series, Shooting Stars, in 2009.

In 2008, he appeared in Peter Kay's talent show parody, Peter Kay's Britain's Got the Pop Factor... and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice, in a duet with the show's protagonist, Geraldine McQueen.

Wilson had a minor role in St Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold, as the rock star boyfriend of Sarah Harding's character, Roxy.

In 2010, he appeared in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1 in a background role as Dirk Cresswell in a scene at the Ministry of Magic. Between November 2012 and January 2013, Wilson took on the role of the Artilleryman in the staged musical, Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds – The New Generation.

On 19 September 2013, Wilson confirmed he would replace Danny O'Donoghue as a coach on the third series of The Voice alongside will.i.am, Tom Jones, and fellow new coach Kylie Minogue, who replaced Jessie J.   In February, Katy B also appeared on the BBC as Wilson's team mentor. 

On 4 April 2015, Wilson was named as the winning coach of The Voice when Stevie McCrorie won the fourth series.

Wilson and Simon Rix wrote and performed the theme tune for Zig and Zag. 

Wilson joined new radio station Radio X in September 2015. He currently presents the Sunday morning show from 11am–2pm.

In October 2015, Wilson became the host of Sky 1's music and comedy panel show Bring the Noise. 

On the 9th April 2016, Wilson was named as the winning coach for the final BBC series of "The Voice" when Kevin Simm won the fifth series. The original idea was that Wilson was leaving his chair after the conclusion of the 5th series, though he also announced that he may return for the ITV series in 2017.

Passage:
Quokka
The quokka (, Setonix brachyurus), the only member of the genus Setonix, is a small macropod about the size of a domestic cat. Like other marsupials in the macropod family (such as kangaroos and wallabies), the quokka is herbivorous and mainly nocturnal. Quokkas can be found on some smaller islands off the coast of Western Australia, in particular on Rottnest Island just off Perth and Bald Island near Albany. A small mainland colony exists in the protected area of Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve, where they co-exist with Gilbert's potoroo.

Traits 

The quokka weighs  and is 40 to long with a 25 to long tail, which is fairly short for a macropod. It has a stocky build, rounded ears, and a short, broad head. Although looking rather like a very small kangaroo, it can climb small trees and shrubs. Its coarse fur is a grizzled brown colour, fading to buff underneath.

The quokka has little fear of humans and it is common for it to approach them closely, particularly on Rottnest Island. It is, however, illegal for members of the public to handle the animals in any way on Rottnest Island. An infringement notice carrying a A$300 fine can be issued by the Rottnest Island Authority for such behaviour.  In addition, prosecution of the offense can result in a fine of up to $2,000.   It has however become popular to take selfies, with the animal, where it seemingly smiles,  causing many to call it 'the happiest animal in the world'. 

Discovery by Europeans 

The quokka was one of the first Australian mammals seen by Europeans. The Dutch mariner Samuel Volckertzoon wrote of sighting "a wild cat" on Rottnest Island in 1658. In 1696, Willem de Vlamingh mistook them for giant rats and named the island "Rotte nest", which comes from the Dutch word rattennest meaning "rat nest".

The word quokka is derived from a Nyungar word, which was probably gwaga. 

Ecology 

In the wild, its roaming is restricted to a very small range in the South-West of Western Australia, with a number of small scattered populations.  There is one large population on Rottnest Island and a smaller population on Bald Island near Albany.  The islands are free of foxes and cats. On Rottnest, quokkas are common and occupy a variety of habitats ranging from semi-arid scrub to cultivated gardens. 

Diet 

Like most macropods, quokkas eat many types of vegetation, including grasses and leaves.  A study found that flowering plants of the genus Guichenotia are one of the quokka's favourite foods. 

Population 

Although numerous on the small offshore islands, the quokka has a very restricted range and is classified as vulnerable. On the mainland, where it is threatened by most introduced predatory species such as foxes, it requires dense ground cover for refuge. Clearfell logging and agricultural development have reduced this habitat, thus contributing to the decline of the species. The introduction of cats and dogs, as well as dingoes, has added to the problem, as has the clearing and burning of the remaining swamplands. Moreover, quokkas usually have a litter size of one and successfully rear one young each year. Although these animals are constantly mating, usually one day after their young is born, the small litter size paired with the restricted space and threatening predators contribute to the scarcity of these marsupials on the mainland. The population on Rottnest Island is 8,000–12,000.
Question:
The quokka is what type of animal?
Answer:
Penises of marsupials
Passage:
Carolyn Keene
Carolyn Keene is the pseudonym of the authors of the Nancy Drew mystery stories and The Dana Girls mystery stories, both produced by the Stratemeyer Syndicate. In addition, the Keene pen name is credited with the Nancy Drew spin-off, River Heights and the Nancy Drew Notebooks.

Edward Stratemeyer, the founder of the Syndicate, hired writers, beginning with Mildred Wirt, later Mildred Wirt Benson, to write the manuscripts for the Nancy Drew books.  The writers initially were paid $125 for each book and were required by their contract to give up all rights to the work and to maintain confidentiality.

Benson is credited as the primary writer of Nancy Drew books under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene.  Harriet Adams (Stratemeyer's daughter) rewrote the original books and added new titles after the withdrawal of Benson. 

Other ghostwriters who used this name to write Nancy Drew mysteries included Leslie McFarlane, James Duncan Lawrence, Walter Karig, Nancy Axelrad, Patricia Doll, Charles S. Strong, Alma Sasse, Wilhelmina Rankin, George Waller Jr., Margaret Scherf, and Susan Wittig Albert. Also involved in the Nancy Drew writing process were Harriet Stratemeyer Adams's daughters, who gave input on the series and sometimes helped to choose book titles; the Syndicate's secretary, Harriet Otis Smith, who invented the characters of Nancy's friends Bess and George; and the editors at Grosset and Dunlap.

In 1979, the Stratemeyer Syndicate changed publishers to Simon & Schuster, a move that the former publishers, Grosset and Dunlap, went to court to prevent, claiming a breach of contract. The decision was made in favor of the Syndicate, stating that they could choose which publisher they would like to use, for subsequent entries in the series.

In 1985, the Syndicate was bought by publishers Simon & Schuster; the Drew books are now handled by Mega-Books, a New York book packager.

Passage:
Faun
The faun (, , phaunos,) is a mythological half human–half goat (from the head to the waist being human, but with the addition of goat horns) manifestation of forest and animal spirits that would help or hinder humans at whim.  They are often associated with the satyrs of Greek mythology. 

Origins

Romans believed fauns inspired fear in men traveling in lonely, remote or wild places. They were also capable of guiding humans in need, as in the fable of The Satyr and the Traveller, in the title of which Latin authors substituted the word Faunus. Fauns and satyrs were originally quite different creatures: whereas fauns are half-man and half-goat, satyrs originally were depicted as stocky, hairy, ugly dwarfs or woodwoses with the ears and tails of horses or asses. Satyrs also were more woman-loving than fauns, and fauns were rather foolish where satyrs had more knowledge.

Ancient Roman mythological belief also included a god named Faunus often associated with enchanted woods and the Greek god Pan  and a goddess named Fauna who were goat people.

File:Gloeden, Wilhelm von (1856-1931) - n. 0425 - da Et in Arcadia, p. 90.jpg|Faun by Wilhelm von Gloeden

The Barberini Faun (located in the Glyptothek in Munich, Germany) is a Hellenistic marble statue from about 200 BCE, found in the Mausoleum of the Emperor Hadrian (the Castel Sant'Angelo) and installed at Palazzo Barberini by Cardinal Maffeo Barberini (later Pope Urban VIII). Gian Lorenzo Bernini restored and refinished the statue. 

The House of the Faun in Pompei, dating from the 2nd century BCE, was so named because of the dancing faun statue that was the centerpiece of the large garden. The original now resides in the National Museum in Naples and a copy stands in its place. 

The French symbolist Stéphane Mallarmé's famous masterpiece L'après-midi d'un faune (published in 1876) describes the sensual experiences of a faun who has just woken up from his afternoon sleep and discusses his encounters with several nymphs during the morning in a dreamlike monologue.  The composer Claude Debussy based his symphonic poem Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune (1894)   on the poem, which also served as the scenario for a ballet entitled L'après-midi d'un faun (or Afternoon of a Faun) choreographed to Debussy's score in 1912 by Vaslav Nijinsky.

It has become a noticeable trend recent years for some fantasy artists to depict fauns as having the hind legs, tail, and antlers of a deer instead those of a goat. This may be due to the English word "faun" sounding the same as the English word for baby deer "fawn".

Fauns in fiction

* The Marble Faun (1860) is a romance set in Italy by Nathaniel Hawthorne. It was said to have been inspired after viewing the Faun of Praxiteles in the Capitoline Museum. 
* Mr. Tumnus, in C. S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia (1949), is a faun. Lewis said that the famous Narnia story, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, all came to him from a single picture he had in his head of a faun carrying an umbrella and parcels through a snowy wood.
* In Lolita, the protagonist is attracted to pubescent girls whom he dubs "nymphets"; "faunlets" are the male equivalent.
* In the 1981 film My Dinner With Andre it is related how fauns befriend and take a mathematician to meet Pan.
* In Guillermo del Toro's 2006 film Pan's Labyrinth (El Laberinto del Fauno), a faun guides the film's protagonist, Ofelia, to a series of tasks, which lead her to a wondrous netherworld.
* Don, in Rick Riordan's The Son of Neptune (2011), is a faun. In the book, several fauns appear, begging for money. Due to his memory of the Greek satyrs, Percy Jackson feels like there should be more to fauns. Also, in the prequel to The Son of Neptune, The Lost Hero, Jason Grace calls Gleeson Hedge a faun upon learning that he is a satyr. In the third instalment in the series, The Mark of Athena, Frank Zhang calls Hedge a faun.
* In The Goddess Within, a visionary fiction novel written by Iva Kenaz, the main heroine falls in love with a faun.
