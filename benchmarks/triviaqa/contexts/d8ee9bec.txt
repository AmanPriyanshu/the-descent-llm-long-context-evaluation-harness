Passage:
Styx
In Greek mythology, Styx (; ) is a deity and a river that forms the boundary between Earth and the Underworld (the domain often called Hades, which also is the name of its ruler). The rivers Styx, Phlegethon, Acheron, Lethe, and Cocytus all converge at the center of the underworld on a great marsh, which sometimes is also called the Styx. According to Herodotus, the river Styx originates near Feneos.  Styx is also a goddess with prehistoric roots in Greek mythology as a daughter of Tethys, after whom the river is named and because of whom it had miraculous powers.

Significance of the River Styx

The deities were bound by the Styx and swore oaths upon Styx. According to classical myths, the reason related for this is that during the Titan war, Styx, the goddess of the river Styx, sided with Zeus. After the war, Zeus promised every oath be sworn upon her.  Zeus swore to give Semele whatever she wanted and was then obliged to follow through when he realized to his horror that her request would lead to her death. Helios similarly promised his son Phaëton whatever he desired, also resulting in the boy's death. Myths related to such early deities did not survive long enough to be included in historic records, but tantalizing references exist among those that have been discovered.

According to some versions, Styx had miraculous powers and could make someone invulnerable. According to one tradition, Achilles was dipped in the waters of the river by his mother during his childhood, acquiring invulnerability, with exception of his heel, by which his mother held him. The only spot where Achilles was vulnerable was his heel, where he was struck and killed by Paris' arrow in the Trojan War. This is the source of the expression Achilles' heel, a metaphor for a vulnerable spot.

Styx was primarily a feature in the afterworld of classical Greek mythology, similar to the Christian area of Hell in texts such as The Divine Comedy and Paradise Lost. The ferryman Charon often is described in contemporary literature as having transported the souls of the newly dead across this river into the underworld, although in the original Greek and Roman sources, as well as in Dante, it was the river Acheron that Charon plied. Dante put Phlegyas as ferryman over the Styx and made it the fifth circle of Hell, where the wrathful and sullen are punished by being drowned in the muddy waters for eternity, with the wrathful fighting each other. In ancient times some believed that placing a coin (Charon's obol) in the mouth  of the deceased would pay the toll for the ferry to cross the Acheron River, which would lead one to the entrance of the underworld. If someone could not pay the fee it was said that they would never be able to cross the river. This ritual was performed by the relatives.

The variant spelling Stix was sometimes used in translations of Classical Greek before the twentieth century.  By metonymy, the adjective stygian came to refer to anything dark, dismal, and murky.

Goddess

Styx was the name of the daughter of Tethys and Oceanus, the goddess of the River Styx. In classical myths, her husband was Pallas and she gave birth to Zelus, Nike, Kratos, and Bia (and sometimes Eos). In those myths, Styx supported Zeus in the Titanomachy, where she was said to be the first to rush to his aid and for this reason her name was given the honor of being a binding oath for the deities. Knowledge of whether this was the original reason for the tradition did not survive into historical records following the religious transition that led to the pantheon of the classical era.

Science

As of 2 July 2013, Styx officially became the name of one of Pluto's moons.  The other moons (Charon, Nix, Hydra, and Kerberos) also have names from Greco-Roman mythology related to the underworld.
Question:
In Greek Mythology who was the ferryman who carried the dead to the underworld across the River Styx?
Answer:
Charon (comics)
Passage:
Interstitial nephritis
Interstitial nephritis  (or tubulo-interstitial nephritis) is a form of nephritis affecting the interstitium of the kidneys surrounding the tubules. This disease can be either acute, meaning it occurs suddenly, or chronic, meaning it is ongoing and eventually ends in kidney failure.

Causes

Commonly causes include infection, or reaction to medication such as an analgesic or antibiotics such as methicillin (meticillin). Reaction to medications causes 71%  to 92%  of cases.

This disease is also caused by other diseases and toxins that damage the kidney.  Both acute and chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis can be caused by a bacterial infection in the kidneys known as pyelonephritis, but the most common cause is by an adverse reaction to a drug.  The drugs that are known to cause this sort of reaction are antibiotics such as penicillin and cephalexin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aspirin less frequently than others), as well as proton-pump inhibitors, rifampicin, sulfa drugs, fluoroquinolones, diuretics, allopurinol, and phenytoin.  The time between exposure to the drug and the development of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis can be anywhere from 5 days to 5 months (fenoprofen induced).

Diagnosis

At times, there are no symptoms of this disease, but when they do occur they are widely varied and can occur rapidly or gradually.      When caused by an allergic reaction, the symptoms of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis are fever (27% of patients), rash (15% of patients), and enlarged kidneys.  Some people experience dysuria, and lower back pain.  In chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis the patient can experience symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weight loss.  Other conditions that may develop include hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and kidney failure.

Blood tests

About 23% of patients have eosinophilia.

Urinary findings

Urinary findings include:
* Eosinophiluria: Original studies with Methicillin-induced AIN showed sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 83%.  The sensitivity is higher in patients with interstitial nephritis induced by methicillin or when the Hansel's stain is used. However, recent studies have called into question the accuracy of this test. A recent study showed that the sensitivity and specificity of urine eosinophil testing are 35.6% and 68% respectively.  
* Isosthenuria 
* Blood in the urine and occasional RBC casts 
* Sterile pyuria: white blood cells and no bacteria
* Nephrotic-range amount of protein in the urine may be seen with NSAID-associated AIN

Gallium scan

The sensitivity of an abnormal gallium scan has been reported to range from 60%  to 100%. 

Treatment

Treatment consists of addressing the cause,  such as by removing an offending drug. There is no clear evidence that corticosteroids help.
Nutrition therapy consists of adequate fluid intake, which can require several liters of extra fluid. 

Prognosis

The kidneys are the only body system that are directly affected by tubulointerstitial nephritis.  Kidney function is usually reduced; the kidneys can be just slightly dysfunctional, or fail completely.

In chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, the most serious long-term effect is kidney failure.  When the proximal tubule is injured, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, uric acid, and phosphate reabsorption may be reduced or changed, resulting in low bicarbonate, known as metabolic acidosis, low potassium, low uric acid known as hypouricemia, and low phosphate known as hypophosphatemia.  Damage to the distal tubule may cause loss of urine-concentrating ability and polyuria.

In most cases of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, the function of the kidneys will return after the harmful drug is not taken anymore, or when the underlying disease is cured by treatment.  If the illness is caused by an allergic reaction, a corticosteroid may speed the recovery kidney function; however, this is often not the case.

Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis has no cure.  Some patients may require dialysis.  Eventually, a kidney transplant may be needed.
Question:
What part of the body does interstitial nephritis affect?
Answer:
Human kidney

Ben Nevis, the Tallest Mountain in the U.K., Just Got a Little Taller
By Andrew MacFarlane
Mar 22 2016 12:15 PM EDT
weather.com
Despite battling rain, sleet and snow, the Ordnance Survey, Britain’s national mapping agency, has found that the U.K.’s tallest mountain has grown a bit taller.
Ben Nevis, the country’s tallest mountain, has a new official height of 4,412 feet (1,345 meters), a full three feet taller than the previous measurement , according to a recent release by the Ordnance Survey.
The difference comes from the accuracy that’s achieved by using modern technologies, like GPS, rather than the surveying methods used when recording the last official measurement in 1949.

"Initially, I thought, 'Well, it's just a number', but then I took a look at the map and thought, 'Oh my, I've just raised the height of the tallest mountain in Britain '," the Ordnance Survey’s Geodetic Consultant Mark Greaves, who was the first to view the increased height, told BBC News.
"And then of course your next reaction is to check and double-check. I had to make sure we'd got it absolutely right," he said.
The new height is already being published on the survey’s new Landranger paper maps and digital maps , according to a separate Ordnance Survey entry.
Conditions weren’t exactly ideal for the trip, but that carried no weight on the survey's outcome, said Angus Hemmings.

“It was raining, sleeting and snowing at the summit, but harsh weather doesn’t affect our equipment or readings,” said Hemmings, a field surveyor. “What it did do though, was give me a greater sense of respect for the 1949 surveyors. Each day they hauled 200lbs of equipment up Ben Nevis and its surrounding mountains.”
Hemmings added that the crew had to wait until night, because strong lights had to be cast from the trig pillars onto other mountains to collect their data.
“It took the surveyors 20 nights, because they only had three clear nights in that period to get it right,” Hemmings said. “Their effort and accuracy is remarkable.”

Passage:
Boris Gromov
Boris Vsevolodovich Gromov (; born 7 November 1943 in Saratov, Russia) is a prominent Russian military and political figure. From 2000 to 2012, he was the Governor of Moscow Oblast.

Biography

He graduated from a Suvorov military cadet school, the Leningrad Military Commanders School and later from the Frunze Military Academy in Moscow, as well as the General Staff Academy.

During the Soviet war in Afghanistan, Gromov did three tours of duty (1980–1982, 1985–1986, 1987–1989), and was best known for the two years as the last Commander of the 40th Army in Afghanistan. Gromov was the last Soviet soldier to leave Afghanistan, crossing on foot the Friendship Bridge spanning the Amu-Daria river on 15 February 1989, the day the Soviet pullout from Afghanistan was completed. He received the highest military award – the golden star of the Hero of the Soviet Union after Operation Magistral had lifted the siege of the city of Khost in eastern Afghanistan.

After the Afghan war, he was chosen as a candidate for Vice President by the Communist Party in the Russian presidential election of 1991 (the candidate for President was former Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov). He served as First Deputy Defence Minister of the Russian Federation. In 1994 Gromov retired from the Russian Military Forces, and was soon appointed deputy Interior Minister. He was elected in 1995 to the State Duma, lower house of Russian parliament. In January 2000 he was elected governor of the Moscow region and re-elected in December 2003.

2013 Nobel Peace Prize
The 2013 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, for their "extensive work to eliminate chemical weapons". The award citation indicated the organization was awarded the prize, because they “have defined the use of chemical weapons as taboo under international law. Recent events in Syria, where chemical weapons have again been put to use, have underlined the need to enhance the efforts to do away with such weapons.”   The committee criticized Russia and the United States for not meeting the extended deadline for destruction of its chemical weapons, and noted that certain countries "are still not members". The OPCW was the 22nd organization to be awarded the prize. 

Nomination

The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced on 4 March 2013, it had received 259 nominations for the prize. This was the highest number of nominations ever: 18 more than the previous record year 2011. Of those 259 nominations, 50 were for organizations. 

Announcement

The winner of the Award was announced on 11 October 2013. The press release indicated that the OPCW was awarded the prize for "its extensive efforts to eliminate chemical weapons". The announcement further reiterated the development of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which establishes the OPCW, as well as earlier instruments such as the Geneva Convention of 1925, but also indicated the use of chemical weapons during World War II and afterwards "by both states and terrorists".

The use of chemical weapons in Syria was also mentioned as a recent event underscoring the importance of elimination of chemical weapons. The OPCW contributed to the UN mission investigating the use of chemical weapons in Ghouta   and its activities since 1 October entailed supervision of destruction activities, which followed the accession of Syria to the Chemical Weapons Convention (and its provisional application), OPCW Executive Council Decision EC-M-33/DEC.1.  and was mandated via the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2118.

The Nobel Committee was critical towards Russia and the United States for not meeting their extended deadlines for the full destruction of its chemical weapons in 2012,  and mentioned that some states "are still not members". Non-member states of the OPCW are the states which are not party to the Chemical Weapons Convention: Angola, Egypt, Israel, Myanmar, North Korea and South Sudan. 

Committee

The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded by the Norwegian Nobel Committee. For the 2013 award, the members were: 

*Thorbjørn Jagland (chair, born 1950), former President of the Storting and former Prime Minister
*Kaci Kullmann Five (deputy chair, born 1951), former member of Parliament and cabinet minister.
*Inger-Marie Ytterhorn (born 1941), former member of Parliament.
*Berit Reiss-Andersen (born 1954), former state secretary for the Minister of Justice and the Police.
*Gunnar Stålsett (born 1935), former bishop of Oslo.

Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons

The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is an intergovernmental organisation, located in The Hague, Netherlands. The organisation promotes and verifies the adherence to the Chemical Weapons Convention which prohibits the use of chemical weapons and requires their destruction. The organization was established on 29 April 1997, upon the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  The verification consists both of evaluation of declarations by member states and on-site inspections. The principal body of the organization is the "conference of states parties", which normally is convened yearly. The Executive Council is the executive organ of the organisation and consists of 41 States Parties. The "Technical Secretariat" applies most of the activities mandated by the Council and is the body where most of the employees of the organisation work. Ahmet Üzümcü is Director-General of the OPCW. 

All 190 parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention are automatically members of the OPCW.  Non-members are Israel and Myanmar, which are signatory states that have not ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention, and Angola, Egypt, North Korea and South Sudan, which have neither signed nor acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention. 

Reaction

OPCW Director-General Ahmet Üzümcü told reporters that he hoped his organisation's work would help "to achieve peace in that country [Syria] and end the suffering of its people." 

United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon congratulated the organisation's work. 

USA Today quoted a London-based Syrian opposition activist who doubted Syrian people would be celebrating the award.  Similarly, a spokesperson for the Syrian National Coalition labelled the prize "ironic". 

Pakistani politician Imran Khan called on the USA and Russia to destroy their own chemical weapons.

Overview
The cast list of distinguished actors who have become distinguished authors is short, and indeed as far as my own reading goes, I can�t think of anyone who rivals Sir Alec Guinness as both an actor of the utmost distinction and a writer of uncommon literary achievement. Blessings in Disguise, which was originally published in 1986, is Sir Alec�s autobiography. It is a profoundly rich, subtly delineated series of sketches of self and others (among the latter, internationally famous British actors such as Gielgud and Richardson).  With an Introduction by Piers Paul Read.

Editorial Reviews
Library Journal
Already a bestseller in England, Guinness's memoir is less autobiography than fond recollections of the many friends (``blessings'') he has accumulated in his long theatrical career. In loosely organized chapters, most centered around one of the major influences in his life (e.g., Sybil Thorndike, John Gielgud), Guinness wanders back and forth through time. The threads of Guinness's own career, marriage, and religious searching wind through these chapters in an amusingly self-deprecatory way. He describes his career as a naval officer during World War II as ``the best performance I have given,'' in a chapter full of hilarious and hair-raising episodes. Sharp imagery and marvelous word portraits make this a charming book of English theatrical lore. Marcia L. Perry, Berkshire Athenaeum, Pittsfield, Mass.
