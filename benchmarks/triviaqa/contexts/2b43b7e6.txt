Passage:
Kevin Lloyd
Kevin Reardon Lloyd (28 March 1949 – 2 May 1998) was an English actor, best known for portraying DC Alfred "Tosh" Lines in Thames Television's The Bill.

Born in Derby, Lloyd trained at East 15 Acting School in Loughton, Essex. Prior to appearing in The Bill he had already played the high-profile role of nightclub owner, Don Watkins, in the soap opera Coronation Street. He also made appearances in a number of other TV shows, including the first series of Starting Out, Boon, Minder, Dear John, Farrington of the F.O., Dempsey and Makepeace, Z-Cars, Andy Capp, Auf Wiedersehen Pet, Blake's 7 and Casualty. His film credits included roles in Trial by Combat (1976), Britannia Hospital (1982), Don't Open till Christmas (1984) and Link (1986).

Lloyd was one of the most popular members of the television show, The Bill. In 1996, the show won the award for "Best TV Drama" at the National Television Awards and it was Lloyd who collected it on behalf of the cast and crew. His Welsh-born father, Ellis Aled Lloyd, was himself a police officer who was killed in an accident while answering an emergency call aged 46 in 1970. 

A chronic alcoholic, he played "Tosh" continuously from 1988 until he was sacked from The Bill in 1998 for his lack of punctuality and failing to learn his lines. Within days, he was admitted to a clinic in Burton upon Trent for detoxification and was administered Antabuse (Disulfiram), but then left the premises to drink alcohol. He returned to the clinic in an intoxicated state, retired to bed, fell asleep, then choked on his vomit. Lloyd died just one week after recording his last scenes for The Bill, and the character of Tosh was still appearing on screen for more than a month after Lloyd's death.

He had been so popular on The Bill that on 26 February 1992, within four years of joining the show, he was selected as special guest for the TV guest show This Is Your Life. 

He was the brother of ITN reporter Terry Lloyd who was killed in the Iraq War in 2003.   His son, James Lloyd, is an actor who also appeared on The Bill between 2004 and 2006.

The Bartender and the Thief
"The Bartender and the Thief" is a 1998 single by Welsh rock band Stereophonics. It was the first single taken from their second album Performance and Cocktails. It was released on 9 November 1998 and reached #3 in the UK charts.

The song is the second track on the Performance and Cocktails album. A live version from Cardiff Castle is available on CD2 of the single. Another live version from Sheffield Arena is on the "Moviestar" single. A bar version of the song is on CD 1 of the "I Wouldn't Believe Your Radio" single.

The music video features the band playing at Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand and is based on the Francis Ford Coppola movie, Apocalypse Now.

The song, which is one of their heavier tracks, is frequently played amongst their live sets. During live performances, vocalist Kelly Jones has been known to utilise the two bars without vocals before the final chorus to reference the Motörhead song "Ace of Spades". The lyrics therefore are "The ace of spades, the ace of spades. The bartender and the thief were lovers..."

Strangely, the song's full length intro only featured on the CD1 single (and in the music video), but was edited off the Performance & Cocktails album.

Welsh PDC Darts player Mark Webster uses this track as his entrance music. An instrumental version of the song is featured in the European version of the PlayStation racing game Gran Turismo 2.

Passage:
Don’t spoil the ship for a ha’p’orth of tar. | word histories
Don’t spoil the ship for a ha’p’orth of tar.  |  word histories
Don’t spoil the ship for a ha’p’orth of tar.
MEANING
 
Don’t risk the failure of a large project by trying to economise on trivial things.
 
ORIGIN
 
Ship is a dialectal pronunciation of sheep, and this proverb was originally to lose the sheep (often the hog) for a halfpennyworth of tar, that is to say, for want of spending a trivial sum on tar, the allusion being to the use of tar either in marking sheep or to protect sores and wounds on sheep from flies (the expression tarred with the same brush also originally alluded to the use of tar by shepherds).
In The Countryman’s Instructor (1636), John Crawshey, who described himself as a “plaine Yorkshire man”, wrote:
To conclude with the old proverbe, hee that will loose a sheepe (or a hogge) for a pennyworth of tarre, cannot deserve the name of a good husband [= farmer]: you may guesse at my meaning.
The noun hog was used to denote a young sheep from the time it is weaned until its first shearing (it was also applied to any of various other farm animals of a year old). In A Collection of English Words not generally used, with their Significations and Original, in two Alphabetical Catalogues, the one of such as are proper to the Northern, the other to the Southern Counties (1691), John Ray (1627-1705) recorded, in North Country Words:
A Hog; a Sheep of a year old; used also in Northampton and Leicester shires, where they also call it a Hoggrel.
And, in South and East Country Words, he wrote:
Hogs; Young Sheep, Northamptonshire. Used also in the same sense in Yorkshire.
John Ray, however, understood hog as meaning domestic pig in A Collection of English Proverbs (1678):
Ne’re lose a hog for an half-penny-worth of tarr.
A man may spare in an ill time: as some who will rather die, then [= than] spend ten groats in Physick. Some have it, lose not a sheep, &c. Indeed tarr is more used about sheep then swine.
The current form of the proverb is first recorded in English Proverbs and Proverbial Phrases (1869), by William Carew Hazlitt (1834-1913):
To spoil the ship for a half-pennyworth of tar.
However, the author adds:
But, in Cornwall, I heard a different version, which appeared to me to be more consistent with probability: “Don’t spoil the sheep for a ha’porth of tar;” and this agrees with a third variation: “Don’t spoil the hog for, &c.,” a hog in some counties (Lincolnshire, for instance,) standing for a sheep of a year old. But, as Mr. Dyce (A General Glossary to Shakespeare’s Works, article ship*) observes, the two words, sheep and ship, seem formerly to have been pronounced very much alike.
(* In fact, this observation appears under sheep: “sheep formerly often pronounced (as it still is in certain counties) ship, and even so written: hence the quibbles”)
In A Concise Dictionary of Phrase and Fable (1993), B. A. Phythian explains that, because of this similarity in pronunciation,
non-countryfolk obviously assumed that the expression referred to a ship, the assumption being reinforced by the reference to tar, which was widely used on wooden ships to coat and preserve the timbers. To complete this transformation of a rustic expression into a nautical-sounding one, the rather extravagant and unconvincing idea of ‘losing’ an entire ship for the sake of a small economy was changed to ‘spoiling’.
Question:
"What usually completes the phrase ""to spoil the ship for a ha'porth of ...""?"
Answer:
Tar-based shampoo
Passage:
Dashiki
The dashiki is a colorful garment for men widely worn in West Africa and also worn in other parts of Africa. It covers the top half of the body. It has formal and informal versions and varies from simple draped clothing to fully tailored suits. A common form is a loose-fitting pullover garment, with an ornate V-shaped collar, and tailored and embroidered neck and sleeve lines.

Etymology

The name dashiki is derived from the Hausa word ', which means shirt. It is usually worn with a brimless Kufi cap which is worn in Islamic communities in Africa and the African diaspora, and a pair of pants. In Ghana, the fabric is commonly known by people as "Angelina".

History in the West 

The dashiki was made popular in the western parts of the world by Oba (Yoruba word for king) Ofuntola Oseijeman Adelabu Adefunmi, who was born Walter Eugene in Detroit, Michigan, USA in 1928. He became interested in African Studies at the age of 16, and traveled to Haiti at the age of 20 in order to be exposed to African religion from indigenous Africans. Soon after, he returned to the U.S. and began a small scale manufacturing business which included African attire, most notably dashikis.

Versions 

The informal version is a traditional print or embroidered dashiki. Three formal versions exist. The first type consists of a dashiki, sokoto (drawstring trousers), and a matching kufi. This style is called a dashiki suit or dashiki trouser set and it is the attire worn by most grooms during wedding ceremonies. The second version consists of an ankle-length shirt, matching kufi, and sokoto and is called a Senegalese kaftan. The third type consists of a dashiki and matching trousers. A flowing gown is worn over these. This type is called a grand boubou or an agbada.

There are several different styles of dashiki suits available from clothing stores. The type of shirt included in the set determines the name. The traditional dashiki suit includes a thigh-length shirt. The short sleeve, traditional style is preferred by purists. A long dashiki suit includes a shirt that is knee-length or longer. However, if the shirt reaches the ankles, it is a Senegalese kaftan. Finally, the lace dashiki suit includes a shirt made of lace. A hybrid of the dashiki and caftan worn by females is a traditional male dashiki with a western skirt.

Wedding colors 

White is the traditional color for West African weddings.   Most grooms wear white dashiki suits during wedding ceremonies.  Some couples wear non-traditional colours. The most common non-traditional colors are purple and blue.
* Purple and lavender: the color of African royalty. 
* Blue: blue is the color of love, peace, and harmony.

Funeral colors

Black and red are the traditional colors of mourning. 

Dashiki in the United States 

The dashiki found a market in America during the black cultural and political struggles in the 1960s. The dashiki was featured in the movies Uptight (1968), Putney Swope (1969), and the weekly television series Soul Train (1971). Jim Brown, Wilt Chamberlain, Sammy Davis Jr., and Bill Russell were among the well-known African-American athletes and entertainers who wore the dashiki on talk shows. Hippies also adopted dashikis into their wardrobe as a means to express counterculture values.  Former District of Columbia mayor and council member Marion Barry was known for wearing a dashiki leading up to elections.

The term dashiki began appearing in print at least as early as 1967. Reporting on the 1967 Newark riots in the Amsterdam News on July 22, 1967, George Barner refers to a new African garment called a "danshiki". An article by Faith Berry in the New York Times Magazine includes it on July 7, 1968.

"Dashiki" formally appeared in the Webster's New World Dictionary, 1st College Edition 1970/72.  It cites J. Benning as having coined the word in 1967.  J. Benning, M. Clarke, H. Davis and W. Smith were founders of New Breed, the first manufacturer of the garment in the United States, Harlem, New York. York Wong joined the company as Financial Vice President in 1971.

Dashiki has been found on many musicians mostly the African-American musicians including famous ones like Chris Brown ,  Beyonce, Rihanna, Zendaya, ScHoolboy Q,Jhene Aiko,  Q-Tip and many more
