Passage:
Scottish Blackface
The Scottish Blackface is the most common breed of domestic sheep in the United Kingdom. This tough and adaptable breed is often found in the more exposed locations, such as the Scottish Highlands or roaming on the moors of Dartmoor. It is also known as Blackfaced Highland, Kerry, Linton, Scottish Mountain, Scottish Highland, Scotch Blackface and Scotch Horn. 
 
Blackfaces are horned in both sexes, and as their name suggests, they usually have a black face (but sometimes with white markings), and black legs.   This breed is primarily raised for meat. 

History

The origins of the breed are uncertain. It was developed on the Anglo-Scottish border but it is not clear exactly when it became a distinct breed. It replaced the earlier Scottish Dunface or Old Scottish Short-wool, a Northern European short-tailed sheep type probably similar to the modern Shetland. 

Records show that in 1503 James IV of Scotland established a flock of 5,000 Scottish Blackface Sheep in Ettrick Forest in the area south of Peebles in the Borders.

Today the Blackface is the most numerous breed in the British Isles.  Roughly thirty percent of all sheep in the UK are Scottish Blackface. The Blackface epitomises the mountain sheep. They have long coarse wool that shields them from moisture and biting winds. They are able to survive the harshest winters in the most extreme parts of Great Britain. 

Several types of Scottish Blackface have developed over the years, but the most common are the Perth variety, which is large framed, with a longer coat, and mainly found in north-east Scotland, Devon, Cornwall and Northern Ireland, and the medium-framed Lanark type, with shorter wool, commonly found in Scotland and Ireland. 

The introduction of Black Faced Highland sheep to America  first occurred in June, 1861, Hugh Brodie imported one ram and two ewes for Brodie & Campbell, New York Mills, New York. In 1867 this flock and  increase was purchased by T. L. Harison of Morley, St. Lawrence County, New York. Isaac Stickney of New York also imported a small flock about 1867 for his farm in Illinois.

Blackface ewes are excellent mothers and will often attempt to defend their lambs against predators.  They are good milkers and are able to yield a lamb crop and a wool clip even when on marginal pastures. The breed spread from the border areas during the 19th century to the highlands and the Scottish islands. They also crossed to Northern Ireland and the US. There are flocks scattered across the USA but this robust little breed has remained a minor breed in North America. Blackface lambs yield a carcass ideal for the modern consumer. The meat is free of superfluous fat and waste and is known the world over for its distinct flavour. Although they are not large sheep they have enormous potential for the production of high quality lean lamb for today's health conscious consumer. There has never been a case of natural occurring Scrapie in a Scottish Blackface Sheep. In a controlled study in the UK goats and Blackface where infected by researchers but there is not one documented case of naturally spread scrapie in a Blackface raised in the USA or the UK. Scrapie, an invariably fatal disease of sheep and goats, is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). The putative infectious agent is the host-encoded prion protein, PrP.

Scottish Blackface wool

Scottish Blackface wool is a speciality wool in a class of its own. There are variations in type of fleece according to the way the sheep were bred. In general, there are a southwest type (short wool) and a central Scotland type (long wool). The southwest type is the finer, with a Bradford count of forty or so, generally classed as short or medium: ewe's fleece of 3 to 4½ lb, greasy. The central type is a stronger wool classed as long or deep strong; this type gives a ewe fleece of 5 to 6½ lb, greasy. The main markets are the mattress and upholstery trade, carpet and heavy cloth trade. Strong Blackface wool undoubtedly makes the best mattress filling there is: the demand for this is very good. The carpet trade all over the world (even New Zealand and Australia) uses large quantities of the medium class of Scottish Blackface wool.
The finer wools are used for blending into many of the strong wearing clothes, over-coating,working tweeds and heavy blankets, The finest Scottish Blackface wool goes to the famous Harris tweed trade.
 
The [http://www.sheepusa.org American Sheep Industry Association] reports an average fibre diameter of 38 to 28 micrometres (or microns), and staple length of 10 to. 

Artisans have long treasured the horns of the Blackface for the carving of shepherd's crooks and walking sticks. In the US the fleeces are becoming of interest to fibre artists and hand spinners for use in tapestry and the making of rugs and saddle blankets.

Scottish Blackface is a breed of which animal?

Sheep
Passage:
Stompie Moeketsi
James Seipei (1974–1989), also known as Stompie Moeketsi, was a teenage United Democratic Front (UDF) activist from Parys in South Africa. He and three other boys were kidnapped on 29 December 1988 by members of Winnie Mandela's bodyguards, known as the Mandela United football club. Moeketsi was murdered on 1 January 1989, the only one of the boys to be killed. 

Activism

Moeketsi joined the street uprising against apartheid in the mid-1980s at age ten, and soon took on a leading role. He became the country's youngest political detainee when he spent his 12th birthday in jail without trial.  At the age of 13 he was expelled from school.

Murder

Moeketsi, together with Kenny Kgase, Pelo Mekgwe and Thabiso Mono, were kidnapped on 29 December 1988 from the Methodist manse in Orlando, Soweto. Moeketsi was accused of being a police informer and after the 4 boys were kidnapped they were pleading and saying that Stompie isn't a police informer. Jerry Richardson, one of the members of Winnie Mandela's Football Club, was carrying a samurai-like sword before he closed the door and screams were heard as Stompie Moeketsi was murdered at the age of 14. His body was found on waste ground near Winnie Mandela's house on 6 January 1989, and recovered by the police. His throat had been cut. Jerry Richardson, one of Winnie Mandela's bodyguards, was convicted of the murder. He claimed that she had ordered him, with others, to abduct the four youths from Soweto, of whom Moeketsi was the youngest. The four were severely beaten.

Involvement of Winnie Mandela

In 1991, Winnie Mandela was convicted of kidnapping and being an accessory to assault,  but her six-year jail sentence was reduced to a fine and a two-year suspended sentence on appeal. In 1992 she was accused of ordering the murder of Dr. Abu-Baker Asvat, a family friend who had examined Seipei at Mandela's house, after Seipei had been abducted but before he had been killed.  Mandela's role was later probed as part of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings, in 1997.  She was said to have paid the equivalent of $8,000 and supplied the firearm used in the killing, which took place on 27 January 1989.  The hearings were later adjourned amid claims that witnesses were being intimidated on Winnie Mandela's orders. 

This incident became a cause célèbre for the apartheid government and opponents of the ANC, and Winnie Mandela's iconic status was dealt a heavy blow.

Appearing before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1997, she said allegations that she was involved in at least 18 human rights abuses including eight murders were "ridiculous" and claimed that her main accuser, former comrade Katiza Cebekhulu, was a former "mental patient" and his allegations against her were "hallucinations".  The Commission found that the abduction had been carried out on Winnie Mandela's instructions, and that she had "initiated and participated in the assaults". However, with regard to the actual murder the Commission found Mandela only "negligent".
Question:
Which famous name was accused f the abduction of Stompie Seipei?
Answer:
Nomzamo Winifred Zanyiwe Madikizela
Passage:
Mens sana in corpore sano
Mens sana in corpore sano is a Latin phrase, usually translated as "a sound mind in a sound body" or "a healthy mind in a healthy body".

In the western world, the phrase is widely used in sporting and educational contexts to express the theory that physical exercise is an important or essential part of mental and psychological well-being.

History

The phrase comes from Satire X of the Roman poet Juvenal (10.356).  It is the first in a list of what is desirable in life:

Traditional commentators believe that Juvenal's intention was to teach his fellow Roman citizens that in the main, their prayers for such things as long life are misguided. That the gods had provided man with virtues which he then lists for them.

Over time and separated from its context, the phrase has come to have a range of meanings.  It can be construed to mean that only a healthy mind can lead to a healthy body, or equally that only a healthy body can produce or sustain a healthy mind.  Its most general usage is to express the hierarchy of needs: with physical and mental health at the root.

An earlier, similar saying is attributed to the pre-Socratic philosopher Thales:

τίς εὐδαίμων, "ὁ τὸ μὲν σῶμα ὑγιής, τὴν δὲ ψυχὴν εὔπορος, τὴν δὲ φύσιν εὐπαίδευτος"
What man is happy? "He who has a healthy body, a resourceful mind and a docile nature."

Leprechauns are a type of fairy, though it's important to note that the fairies of Irish folklore were not cute Disneyfied pixies; they could be lustful, nasty, capricious creatures whose magic might delight you one day and kill you the next if you displeased them.
Leprechauns are often described as wizened, bearded old men dressed in green (early versions were clad in red) and wearing buckled shoes, often with a leather apron. Sometimes they wear a pointed cap or hat and may be smoking a pipe.
Leprechaun lore
In their book "The Element Encyclopedia of Magical Creatures," John and Caitlin Matthews trace leprechaun legends back to eighth-century legends of water spirits called "luchorpán," meaning small body. These sprites eventually merged with a mischievous household fairy said to haunt cellars and drink heavily.
Other researchers say that the word leprechaun may be derived from the Irish leath bhrogan, meaning shoemaker. Indeed, though leprechauns are often associated with riches and gold, in folklore their main vocation is anything but glamorous: they are humble cobblers, or shoemakers. Shoemaking is apparently a lucrative business in the fairy world, since each leprechaun is said to have his own pot of gold, which can often be found at the end of a rainbow.
According to Irish legends, people lucky enough to find a leprechaun and capture him (or, in some stories, steal his magical ring, coin or amulet) can barter his freedom for his treasure. Leprechauns are usually said to be able to grant the person three wishes. But dealing with leprechauns can be a tricky proposition.
A trickster
The leprechaun plays several roles in Irish folklore; he is principally a roguish trickster figure who cannot be trusted and will deceive whenever possible. In her encyclopedia "Spirits, Fairies, Leprechauns, and Goblins," folklorist Carol Rose offers a typical tale of leprechaun trickery "concerning a man who managed to get a leprechaun to show him the bush in the field where his treasure was located. Having no spade [shovel], the man marked the tree with one of his red garters, then kindly released the sprite and went for a spade. Returning almost instantly he found that every one of the numerous trees in the field sported a red garter!"
In the magical world, most spirits, fairies and other creatures have a distinctive sound that is associated with them. Some entities — such as the Irish fairy banshee and the Hispanic spirit La Llorona — are said to emit a mournful wail signifying their presence. In the case of the leprechaun, it's the tap-tap-tapping of his tiny cobbler hammer, driving nails into shoes, that announces they are near.
In his collection of Irish fairy and folk tales, W.B. Yeats offered an 18th-century poem by William Allingham titled "The Lepracaun; Or, Fairy Shoemaker" which describes the sound:
"Lay your ear close to the hill.
Do you not catch the tiny clamour,
Busy click of an elfin hammer,
Voice of the Lepracaun singing shrill
As he merrily plies his trade?"
The 1825 publication of a book called "Fairy Legends" seemingly cemented the character of the modern leprechaun: "Since that time leprechauns seem to be entirely male and solitary," they note.
It seems that all leprechauns are not only shoemakers but also old male loners, which makes sense from a cultural standpoint, since that type of fairy is so closely associated with shoemaking, a traditionally male vocation. Though there is something curious about all leprechauns being cobblers (what if they want to be writers, farmers, or doctors?), this designation also fits in well with the traditional folkloric division of labor among fairies.
Leprechauns in popular culture
As with many old legends and traditions, the image and nature of the leprechaun has changed over time and has been updated (and in some cases sanitized) for a modern audience. Lucky the Leprechaun, mascot of the General Mills breakfast cereal Lucky Charms, is probably the best-known fairy of his type.
On the other end of the spectrum there's the homicidal leprechaun Lubdan in the "Leprechaun" horror/comedy film series (played by "Willow" actor Warwick Davis). For generations, some Irish have been annoyed by leprechauns and the ethnic stereotypes they perpetuate, and for most Americans leprechauns only appear around St. Patrick's Day .
Leprechauns offer a morality tale figure whose fables warn against the folly of trying to get rich quick, take what's not rightfully yours or interfere with "The Good Folk" and other magical creatures. Belief in leprechauns and other fairies was once widespread on the Emerald Isle , and real or not they will continue to amuse and delight us for centuries more.

Lowell Observatory
Lowell Observatory is an astronomical observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, United States. Lowell Observatory was established in 1894, placing it among the oldest observatories in the United States, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965.  In 2011, the Observatory was named one of "The World's 100 Most Important Places" by TIME. It was at the Lowell Observatory that the dwarf planet Pluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh.

The Observatory's original 24 in Alvan Clark & Sons Telescope is still in use today for public education. Lowell Observatory hosts 85,000 visitors per year at their Steele Visitors Center, who take guided daytime tours and view various wonders of the night sky through the Clark Telescope and other telescopes. It was founded by astronomer Percival Lowell of Boston's well-known Lowell family and is overseen by a sole trustee, a position historically handed down through the family. The first trustee was Lowell's third cousin Guy Lowell (1916–1927). Percival's nephew Roger Putnam served from 1927–1967, followed by Roger's son Michael (1967–1987), Michael's brother William Lowell Putnam III (1987–2013), and current trustee W. Lowell Putnam.

The observatory operates several telescopes at three locations in the Flagstaff area. The main facility, located on Mars Hill just west of downtown Flagstaff, houses the original 24 in Clark Refracting Telescope, although its role today is as a public education tool and not research. The telescope, built in 1896 for $20,000, was assembled in Boston by Alvan Clark & Sons and then shipped by train to Flagstaff. Also located on the Mars Hill campus is the 13 in Pluto Discovery Telescope, used by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 to discover the dwarf planet Pluto.

Lowell Observatory currently operates four research telescopes at its Anderson Mesa dark sky site, located 20 km southeast of Flagstaff, including the 72 in Perkins Telescope (in partnership with Boston University) and the 42 in John S. Hall Telescope. Lowell is a partner with the United States Naval Observatory and Naval Research Laboratory in the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI) also located at that site. The Observatory also operates smaller research telescopes at its historic site on Mars Hill and in Australia and Chile.

Past Anderson Mesa, on the peak of Happy Jack, Lowell Observatory has also built and is commissioning the  Discovery Channel Telescope in partnership with Discovery Communications, Inc.

History (see discoveries below)

Aside from the wide array of research and discoveries listed below, one science program carried out at the Observatory was the measurement of the variability of solar irradiance.  When Harold L. Johnson took over as the director in 1952, the stated objective became to focus on light from the Sun reflecting from Uranus and Neptune. In 1953, the current 21 in telescope was erected. Beginning in 1954, this telescope began monitoring the brightness of these two planets, and comparing these measurements with a reference set of sunlike stars.

Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT)  

Lowell Observatory is building a major new reflecting telescope in partnership with Discovery Communications, located near Happy Jack, Arizona. This Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT), located within the Mogollon Rim Ranger District of the Coconino National Forest, is expected to be the fifth-largest telescope in the contiguous United States, and it will enable the astronomers of Lowell Observatory to enter new research areas deeper into outer space.

The DCT and the research carried out there will be the focus of ongoing informative and educational television programs about astronomy, the sciences, and technology to be telecast on the Discovery channels. The primary mirror of the Discovery Channel Telescope will be  in diameter. It will be supposely notable for its uncommon meniscus design for such a large mirror. This mirror was ground and polished into its parabolic shape at the Optical Fabrication and Engineering Facility of the College of Optical Sciences of the University of Arizona (in Tucson, Arizona).

Current research 

Lowell Observatory's astronomers conduct research on a wide range of solar system and astrophysical topics using ground-based, airborne, and space-based telescopes. Among the many current programs are a search for near-Earth asteroids, a survey of the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, a search for extrasolar planets, a decades-long study of the brightness stability of the sun, and a variety of investigations of star formation and other processes in distant galaxies. In addition, the Observatory staff designs and builds custom instrumentation for use on Lowell's telescopes and elsewhere. For example, Lowell staff built a sophisticated high-speed camera for use on the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). SOFIA is a joint project of the United States and German space agencies and consists of a  telescope on board a Boeing 747 SP.

Notable discoveries 

*The dwarf planet Pluto by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930
*Large recessional velocities of galaxies by Vesto Melvin Slipher between 1912 and 1914 (that led ultimately to the realization our universe is expanding)
*Co-discovery of the rings of Uranus in 1977

Tiergarten Schönbrunn
Tiergarten Schönbrunn (literally, "Schönbrunn Zoo"), or "Vienna Zoo", is a zoo located on the grounds of the famous Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna, Austria. Founded as an imperial menagerie in 1752, it is the oldest zoo in the world.
Today, Tiergarten Schönbrunn is considered and regards itself as a scientifically administered zoo which sees its main purpose as a centre for species conservation and general nature conservation as well as in the fulfillment of the education mandate given to it by the legislation. The still preserved buildings of the baroque era, which have been complemented in the last years by elements of modern zoo architecture, still convey a good impression of the 18th century menagerie-buildings after the Versailles model.

Description

Tiergarten Schönbrunn is one of the few zoos worldwide to house giant pandas.  The zoo's pandas are named Yang Yang (F), Long Hui (M), Fu Long (M), and Fu Hu (M).   Fu Long's birth on 23 August 2007 was the first natural insemination panda birth in Europe.   Fu Hu was born exactly 3 years later, and he was also conceived by natural mating.  One more panda cub, Fu Bao (福豹), was born nearly three years later on 14 August 2013 via natural mating. 

Other zoo attractions include a rainforest house, in which the spectator is led through a simulation of the Amazon rainforest, an aquarium, which enables  spectators to walk through underneath a simulation of the Amazon in flood, and, more recently, an exhibit of animals in unnatural habitats.  The new polarium for animals of the Arctic region was opened in early 2004.

On 14 July 1906, the zoo saw the birth of the first elephant in captivity. 

From its privatization in 1992, it has been led by Helmut Pechlaner, also president of WWF Austria, who managed to modernize most parts of the zoo and sustain its financial situation. Nowadays, as of 2014, the zoo is managed by Dagmar Schratter.

Private and corporate sponsorship for the various animals is one of the methods employed by the zoo today, along with bookable night excursions and special children's programs. Zoological research takes place at the zoo.

History

The zoo was constructed in 1752 next to Schloss Schönbrunn by Adrian van Stekhoven at the order of the then Holy Roman Emperor, Francis I, husband of Maria Theresia, to serve as an imperial menagerie. It was centered around a pavilion meant for imperial breakfasts. Therefore, thirteen animal enclosures in the form of cut cake pieces were established around this central pavilion.

The central pavilions and the menagerie building were built by Jean Nicolas Jadot de Ville-Issey. A small zoo had already existed on the premises since 1540, but the complex was opened to the public only in 1779. Initially, there were no entrance fees.

Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II organized expeditions to Africa and the Americas to procure specimens for the zoo. The arrival of the first giraffe in 1828 influenced Viennese fashion and city life. Clothes', accessories', and other items' designs were influenced, and Adolf Bäuerle performed his play titled Giraffes in Vienna ().

At the onset of World War I, the zoo was home to 712 species and 3,500 specimens. Due to diminishing food supplies during the war, the number of specimens rapidly sank to 900. After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after the war, the zoo became the responsibility of the Austrian Republic.

Bombing raids on February 19 and February 21, 1945, during World War II, had an even greater impact on the zoo. Many buildings were destroyed and specimens killed, reducing the stock of specimens to 400. The new zoo director, Dr. Julius Brachetka, eventually managed to restore the zoo.

The zoo experienced a financial crisis in the 1980s, but closure of the zoo was prevented by privatization in 1992. Dr. Helmut Pechlaner was assigned as manager of the zoo. After his retirement on 1 January 2007, his deputy, Dr. Dagmar Schratter, took over his post.

Pechlaner was able to renovate and extend many of the enclosures thanks to a number of sponsors and significantly increased entrance fees. During his time as manager, the zoo was extended by a number of new buildings, including the rainforest house, the desert house, and the "Tyrolean farmhouse". A number of rare and exotic specimens, such as giant pandas and koalas, were attracted to the zoo and contributed to its upswing in popularity.

In the media

A number of tragic accidents have plagued the zoo. In 2002, a jaguar attacked a caretaker during feeding, killing her in front of zoo visitors. The director tried to help and sustained heavy arm injuries. In February 2005, a young elephant, Abu, lethally crushed his caretaker. In the following press storm, director Pechlaner offered to resign over the issue. 

The zoo is a filming location for the ORF series, Tom Turbo, which is based on a series of children's books by Thomas Brezina. Tom Turbo has its garage at the zoo since 2006, and is, together with its creator, sponsor of a tiger at the zoo. Former zoo director Pechlaner makes cameo appearances in a number of episodes.

The 250 Years Vienna Zoo Silver Coin

The zoo is so popular and famous that on its 250th anniversary, it was the topic of one of the most famous silver collectors' coins: the 5 euro 250 Years of Vienna Zoo commemorative coin minted on 8 May 2002.

The reverse shows the Emperor's Pavilion surrounded by a variety of animals from the zoo. The dates 1752-2002 refer to the anniversary and, of course, date the coin itself.

Passage:
Five-spice powder
Five-spice powder is a spice mixture of five spices, used primarily in Chinese cuisine but also used in other Asian  and Arabic cookery.

Formula

While there are many variants, a common mix is: 
*Star anise (bajiao, 八角) 
*Cloves (dingxiang, 丁香)
*Chinese Cinnamon (rougui, 肉桂)
*Sichuan pepper (huajiao, 花椒)
*Fennel seeds (xiaohuixiang, 小茴香)
Other recipes may contain anise seed or ginger root, nutmeg, turmeric, Amomum villosum pods (砂仁),  Amomum cardamomum pods (白豆蔻), licorice, Mandarin orange peel or galangal. In South China Cinnamomum loureiroi and Mandarin orange peel is commonly used as a substitute for Cinnamomum cassia and cloves, respectively, producing a different flavour for southern five-spice powders.

Use

Five spice may be used with fatty meats such as pork, duck or goose. It is used as a spice rub for chicken, duck, pork and seafood, in red cooking recipes, or added to the breading for fried foods. Five spice is used in recipes for Cantonese roasted duck, as well as beef stew. It is used as a marinade for Vietnamese broiled chicken. The five-spice powder mixture has followed the Chinese diaspora and has been incorporated into other national cuisines throughout Asia.

Although this mixture is used in restaurant cooking, many Chinese households do not use it in day-to-day cooking.  In Hawaii, some restaurants place a shaker of the spice on each patron's table. A seasoned salt can be easily made by dry-roasting common salt with five-spice powder under low heat in a dry pan until the spice and salt are well mixed.

Singer
The first Singer cars - built under licence from Lea-Francis and designed by Alex Craig - were produced in 1905 by George Singer, who had worked for Coventry Machinists before producing cycle, tricycles and then cars.
Singer died a year after the company went into receivership (in 1908) and the firm was re-established as Singer and Co. (1909) Ltd.
Early models from the new business…
Overhead camshaft in-line four-cylinder 875cc Chamois: 39bhp; Chamois Sport: 51bhp
0-60 mph:
Chamois: 23.5 sec; Chamois Sport: 16+ sec
Top Speed:
Chamois: 80 mph; Chamois Sport: 90 mph
MPG:
Chamois: 35-45; Chamois Sport: 30-40+
A great little car, now rare but worth tracking down for its fine mix of fun, civility and classy looks. The Chamois was a luxury version of the Hillman Imp, with a plusher interior, better soundproofing and sporty instrumentation, plus jazzier exterior bright work. Introduced in late 1964, the upmarket newcomer was powered by the same rev-happy engine as used in the less expensive Hillman. For 1966, the excellent Singer Chamois Sport arrived using the same peppy Imp Sport spec, while there was even a coupe based upon the Sunbeam Stiletto. For 1969, the Chamois featured quadruple headlamps but range was killed off just a year later.

Passage:
Saussurea
Saussurea is a genus of about 300 species of flowering plants in the thistle tribe within the daisy family, native to cool temperate and arctic regions of Asia, Europe, and North America, with the highest diversity in alpine habitats in the Himalaya and central Asia. Common names include saw-wort and snow lotus, the latter used for a number of high altitude species in central Asia.

They are perennial herbaceous plants, ranging in height from dwarf alpine species 5–10 cm tall, to tall thistle-like plants up to 3 m tall. The leaves are produced in a dense basal rosette, and then spirally up the flowering stem. The flowers form in a dense head of small capitula, often surrounded by dense white to purple woolly hairs; the individual florets are also white to purple. The wool is densest in the high altitude species, and aid in thermoregulation of the flowers, minimising frost damage at night, and also preventing ultraviolet light damage from the intense high altitude sunlight.

De Candolle named the genus after Horace-Bénédict de Saussure (1740-1799) and Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure (1767–1845). 

Uses

A number of the high alpine Himalayan species are grown as ornamental plants for their decorative dense woolly flowerheads; they are among the most challenging plants to grow, being adapted to harsh climates from 3500–5000 m altitude, demanding cool temperatures, a very long (up to 8–10 months) winter rest period, and very good soil drainage in humus-rich gravel soils.

Traditional uses 

Costi amari radix or costus root was an important item of Roman trade with India, and is believed to have been the dried root of Saussurea lappa. 

Several varieties of snow lotus are used in traditional Tibetan medicine. Saussurea lappa is used a component of the traditional Tibetan medicine Padma 28.  Research conducted on the Himalayan medicinal plants by C.P. Kala reveals that the practitioners of Tibetan medicine living in the Pin Valley of Himachal Pradesh use its root for curing dysentery and ulcer.  Saussurea involucrata flowers and stems have long been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, cough with cold, stomachache, dysmenorrhea, and altitude sickness, and has been found to have antiinflammatory, cardiotonic, abortifacient, anticancer, and antifatigue actions. 

Saussurea obvallata, known as "brahmakamala" in India is one of the most sacred species, and it has been used for offerings to goddess Nanda Devi for time immemorial.  

Pharmacology

Saussurea lappa and has been shown to inhibit the mRNA expression of iNOS by lipopolysaccharide stimulated macrophages, thus reducing nitric oxide production.  In rats, high doses of 50-200 milligrams per kilogram of crude ethanolic extract reduced observed inflammation in standard laboratory tests, and 25-100 milligrams per kilogram of the sesquiterpene fraction of the extract reduced several molecular markers of inflammation.    Ethanol extracts were shown to have analgesic and antiinflammatory effects at high doses of 75-300 milligrams per kilogram.  As the slow-growing wild plant is endangered by collections, a substitute grown in tissue culture has been suggested, which is mostly equivalent.  Generally the analgesic and antiinflammatory effects of the plant are much inferior to those of 10 milligrams of indomethacin.

Literature and culture

In most Chinese martial arts literature, the snow Lotus was classified a rare herb as precious as lingzhi mushroom, and old ginseng.

  Ports from Japan
There are 1020 ports in Japan, 22 of which are main ports of special purpose, 106 main ports and 892 local ports.
Most frequently port-managing organizations are city municipalities (395 ports) or prefecture administrations (619 ports). The development of most significant for economics Japanese ports is financed 2/3 by government means; the remaining part is financed by port-managing organizations. Ministry of land infrastructure and transport in Japan can provide with stock capital for the securities that are issued by port-managing organizations if the project that is being carried into effect is important on the state scale. Port managing organizations prepare port development plans.
City municipalities accomplish territorial planning. Port territory utilization, change of purpose or assimilation of new territories is always foreseen in the city detailed plan. Port investment projects are estimated on the economic aspect, most frequently without financial estimation. The aim is not to gain profit from the port activity but broader influence on the economy while estimating the relationship between costs and profit. Impressive projects are being put into practice in all visited ports:
1. In Kobe port the whole activity is concentrated on made-up islands, i.e. Port Island (the beginning of formation the year 1965 - the first in Japan) and Rokko Island (1982). The territories between piers situated in the old port on the coast are strewed forming new territories that are generally of non-industrial purpose: office buildings, parks, and dwelling houses. The state invests in the main infrastructure, breakwaters, capital dredging, greatest berths; the city - generally in the formation of territory, berths, covers, cranes that load cargo to the ships.
2. Osaka port develops similarly as in Kobe port (as well as the other major ports - Tokyo, Jokohama): large islands are formed that are used for both port activity and other purposes (entertainments, business and dwelling districts). Contracts concerning the usage of new terminals are signed before the construction works. Tenders are organized where the members of the commission are the representatives of ministries, city and educational institutions. For example, in the case of the terminal that was visited, the winner has become the only one participant (Evergreen), that later invested in the cranes mounted on container reloading sites. Length of berth of the terminal - 300 m, depth of the territory (maximum distance from the berth) 600 m.
3. Tokyo astonishes with its extensive port development scale: 300 billion yens are invested in the protective berths of one island, it is planned to increase the port island up to 400 hectares.

Why does the poet say that triumph and disaster are two imposters in the poem "If" by Rudyard Kipling?
carol-davis | College Teacher | (Level 1) Educator Emeritus
Posted on
Over the Wimbledon Tennis court tunnel which takes the players back to the locker room  is this phrase:
If you can meet with Triumph and disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same.
What a wonderful poem! It is one of the most beloved poems in literature, and its message is timeless. In the poem, “If,”  Rudyard Kipling gives advice to his son on how to become a man; yet his advice rings true for everyone.
This poem is labeled a didactic poem because its purpose is to teach.  In each stanza, Kipling provides guidance in some aspect of life.
The first stanza covers building self-confidence, never giving up, not judging other people too harshly, being patient, and loving not hating.
In the second stanza, the poet’s instructions include always dreaming, using his  intelligence, and ignoring fools. 
The two lines above the Wimbledon tunnel are found in stanza 2.What do the these lines mean? Triumph  signifies  winning, victory, success, and achievement.Those words are easy to live with.   However, as the adage states, Winning is not everything.  If a person does win a tennis match, the spelling bee, the beauty pageant--never boast  but show sportsmanship toward the fellow competitors.  Doing the best a person can do is winning no matter what the outcome.
On the other hand, disaster brings a different set of circumstances: tragedy, adversity, loving, misfortune, and defeat.  Not situations that anyone finds comforting.  With this idea comes losing with grace, remembering that he did the best he could do--  then there is no loser.
Kipling does personify these words.  Personification ascribes human qualities to something.  Here these two aspects of life are given the ability to be imposters.  They are pretenders because both situations  are fleeting [They do not last!] Winning is great, but it is only temporary.  Thankfully, disaster is momentary as well. Everyone wants to win,  and nobody wants to lose. It is the grace that one shows in either situation that makes these imposters ludicrous.
Remember that the  tennis players know both triumph when they  win, and disaster when they  lose.  There is only one winner and many losers. Each year, the athletes keep coming back to play the game that they love. These people know that it is not whether you lose or win, it is how you play the game.  Kipling ends his poem with this  assurance:
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
And---which is more---you'll be a Man, my son!

Answer:

Passage:
Interrobang
The interrobang (), also known as the interabang,  ‽ (often represented by ?! or !?), is a nonstandard punctuation mark used in various written languages and intended to combine the functions of the question mark (also called the "interrogative point")  and the exclamation mark or exclamation point (known in printers' and programmers' jargon as the "bang").  The glyph is a superimposition of these two marks. The word itself is an example of a portmanteau that incorporates an onomatopoeia.

Application

A sentence ending with an interrobang asks a question in an excited manner, expresses excitement or disbelief in the form of a question, or asks a rhetorical question.

For example:  
* You call that a hat‽
* You're pregnant‽

In informal English, the same inflection is usually notated by ending a sentence with first a question mark and then an exclamation mark, or vice versa. Many people are unfamiliar with the interrobang, and would be puzzled when first seeing it, although its intention is usually self-evident. The interrobang can be hand-written with a single stroke plus the dot. One common application is in cartoons, as a stand-alone symbol of surprise.

History

 

Many writers, especially in informal writing, have used multiple punctuation marks to end a sentence expressing surprise and question.

What the...?! Neves, Called Dead in Fall, Denies It (headline from San Francisco Examiner, May 9, 1936)

Writers using informal language may use several alternating question marks and exclamation marks for even more emphasis:

He did what?!?!?!
Like multiple exclamation marks and multiple question marks, such strings count as poor style in formal writing. 

The combinations "!?" and "?!" are also used to express judgements of particular chess moves through their use as punctuation in chess annotation. "!?" denotes an "interesting" move, while "?!" denotes a "dubious" move.

Invention

American Martin K. Speckter conceptualized the interrobang in 1962. As the head of an advertising agency, Speckter believed that advertisements would look better if copywriters conveyed surprised rhetorical questions using a single mark. He proposed the concept of a single punctuation mark in an article in the magazine TYPEtalks. Speckter solicited possible names for the new character from readers. Contenders included exclamaquest, QuizDing,  rhet, and exclarotive, but he settled on interrobang. He chose the name to reference the punctuation marks that inspired it: interrogatio is Latin for "a rhetorical question" or "cross-examination";  bang is printers' slang for the exclamation mark. Graphic treatments for the new mark were also submitted in response to the article.Haley, Allan. 

Early interest

In 1966, Richard Isbell of American Type Founders issued the Americana typeface and included the interrobang as one of the characters. In 1968, an interrobang key was available on some Remington typewriters. During the 1970s, one could buy replacement interrobang keycaps and typefaces for some Smith-Corona typewriters. 
The interrobang was in vogue for much of the 1960s, with the word interrobang appearing in some dictionaries and the mark itself featuring in magazine and newspaper articles.

Continued support

Although most fonts do not include the interrobang, it has not disappeared: Lucida Grande, the default font for many UI elements of legacy versions of Apple's OS X operating system, includes the interrobang, and Microsoft provides several versions of the interrobang character as part of the Wingdings 2 character set (on the right bracket and tilde keys on US keyboard layouts) available with Microsoft Office.  It was accepted into Unicode  and is present in several fonts, including Lucida Sans Unicode, Arial Unicode MS, and Calibri, the default font in the Office 2007, 2010 and 2013 suites. 

Inverted interrobang

A reverse and upside down interrobang (combining ¿ and ¡, Unicode character: ⸘), suitable for starting phrases in Spanish, Galician and Asturian, which use inverted question and exclamation marks, is called an "inverted interrobang" or a gnaborretni (interrobang written backwards).  In current practice, interrobang-like emphatic ambiguity in Hispanic languages is usually achieved by including both sets of punctuation marks one inside the other (¿¡Verdad!? or ¡¿Verdad?! [Really!?]).  Older usage, still official but not widespread, recommended mixing the punctuation marks: ¡Verdad? or ¿Verdad! 

Entering and display

The interrobang is not a standard punctuation mark. Few modern typefaces or fonts include a glyph for the interrobang character. The standard interrobang is at Unicode code point .  The inverted interrobang is at Unicode code point .  Single-character versions of the double-glyph versions are also available at code points  and .

The interrobang can be used in some word processors with the alt code  when working in a font that supports the interrobang, or using an operating system that performs font substitution.

Depending on the browser and which fonts the user has installed, some of these may or may not be displayed or may be substituted with a different font.

On a Linux system supporting the Compose Key, an interrobang can be produced by pressing the compose key followed by the exclamation point and the question mark; reversing the order creates the inverted interrobang.  On Mac OS X, it is found on the Character Palette, obtained by pressing the key combination .

The interrobang can be displayed in LaTeX by using the package textcomp and the command \textinterrobang. The inverted interrobang is also provided for in the textcomp package through the command \textinterrobangdown.

Prominent uses

The State Library of New South Wales, New South Wales, Australia, uses an interrobang as its logo,  as does educational publishing company Pearson, who intend it to convey "the excitement and fun of learning". 

Chief Judge Frank H. Easterbrook used an interrobang in the 2012 Seventh Circuit opinion Robert F. Booth Trust v. Crowley.

Passage:
Spraint
Spraint is the dung of the otter. 

Spraints are typically identified by smell and are known for their distinct aromas, the smell of which has been described as ranging from freshly mown hay to putrefied fish.  The European otter's spraints are black and slimy,  long and deposited in groups of up to four in prominent locations near water. They contain scales, shells and bones of water creatures.  Because of the decline of otters in Britain, several surveys have been made to record the distribution of the animal, usually by recording the presence of spraint.
  Further, there is some evidence that spraint density is correlated with otter density.
Question:
Finding its spraint means what animal has been there?

Question:
Donnie Wahlberg is/was a member of which 'Boy' band?
Answer:
New Kids on the Block
Passage:
Ace Payroll: Christmas and New Year 2016/2017
Ace Payroll: Christmas and New Year 2016/2017
Christmas and New Year 2016/2017
Christmas Day is on Sunday 25th December 2016 and Boxing Day is Monday 26th December 2016.
New Years Day is Sunday 1st January 2017, with the day after being Monday 2nd January 2017.
If Sunday is a normal working day for an employee, then the Sunday is a public holiday for that employee.
If the employee does not usually work on a Sunday, then the following Tuesday becomes a public holiday.
To check the dates in future years, see the Public Holiday Calendar FAQ.

Christmas and New Year 2012/2013
The following is the advice from the Employment Relations Service.
If the holiday falls on a weekend, and your employee doesn't normally work on the weekend, the holiday is transferred to the following Monday or Tuesday so that the employee still gets a paid day off.
If the holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday and the employee normally works on that day, then the holiday remains at the traditional day and the employee is entitled to that day off on pay.
An employee cannot be entitled to more than four public holidays over the Christmas and New Year period, regardless of his or her work pattern.
Christmas and New Year's Day this year fall on a Sunday.  I understand that in this case, Tuesday becomes the public holiday.  In my business, the staff work on all three of these days.  Do I have to pay them time and a half for the Sunday, or the Monday and Tuesday, or all three?
First, determine which of the days would be a normal working day for the employee if it were not Christmas. Once determined, the following applies
If the same staff member usually works all three days, Sunday are Monday are the public holidays. For working those two days you pay time and a half, plus allow the two alternative holidays. For them, Tuesday is not a public holiday.
If a staff member works just the Sunday and Monday, or just the Monday and Tuesday, then in both these cases, both days are public holidays. Pay time and a half and allow a day in lieu for each day worked.
If an employee usually works just the Sunday and Tuesday, then only the Sunday is a public holiday. The Tuesday is not a public holiday for this employee, because the Tuesday only becomes a public holiday if the employee does not usually work on the Sunday.
If an employee would only usually work one of the days between Sunday and Tuesday, then irrespective of which day it is, it is to be treated as a public holiday.
This is covered by Section 45 which has changed the handling of the four public holidays at Christmas and New Year.
Section 45
Transfer of public holidays over Christmas and New Year
(1)  For the purposes of this subpart, if any of the public holidays listed in section 44(1)(a) to (d) (christmas and new year)
(a)  falls on a Saturday and the day would otherwise be a working day for the employee, the public holiday must be treated as falling on that day:
(b)  falls on a Saturday and the day would not otherwise be a working day for the employee, the public holiday must be treated as falling on the following Monday:
(c)  falls on a Sunday and the day would otherwise be a working day for the employee, the public holiday must be treated as falling on that day:
(d)  falls on a Sunday and the day would not otherwise be a working day for the employee, the public holiday must be treated as falling on the following Tuesday.
(2)  To avoid doubt, this section does not entitle an employee to more than 4 public holidays for the days listed in section 44(1)(a) to (d) (christmas and new year).
What this section effectively says is
If the Christmas or New Year holidays fall on a Saturday or Sunday, and the employee normally works on a Saturday or Sunday, then the Saturday or Sunday are public holidays.
If an employee does not usually work on the Saturday or Sunday, then the public holidays are the following Monday or Tuesday.
My employee works Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  We are closing on Sunday - Christmas Day but will be working every other day. What does the employee get?
Your employee normally works Sunday, but not Monday or Tuesday.
Therefore the Monday and Tuesday days are irrelevant.
They are not working on Sunday because you are closed. Therefore the employee takes that day as a public holiday, and gets paid what they would normally earn on that day.
Public Holidays In Ace Payroll
To pay an employee for a public holiday, from the Pay Calculation screen click Leave , then select either Public Holiday Taken or Public Holiday Worked.
For every employee, there are only three possibilities
Public Holiday Taken
Select this option if the employee did not work on the public holiday, but would have worked had the day not been a public holiday.
For detailed documentation, see the Public Holiday Taken FAQ.
Public Holiday Worked
For detailed documentation, see the Public Holiday Worked FAQ.
Not Entitled To Public Holiday
If the public holiday falls on a day that would not otherwise have been a working day for the employee, do nothing.
The employee is not entitled to any sort of payment in these circumstances.
