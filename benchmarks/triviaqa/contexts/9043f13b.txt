Philosopher
A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theological dogma or science.  The term "philosopher" comes from the Ancient Greek  (philosophos) meaning "lover of wisdom". Its origination has been ascribed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras. 

In the classical sense, a philosopher was someone who lived according to a certain way of life, focusing on resolving existential questions about the human condition, and not someone who discourses upon theories or comments upon authors.  Typically, these particular brands of philosophy are Hellenistic ones and those who most arduously commit themselves to this lifestyle may be considered philosophers.

In a modern sense, a philosopher is an intellectual who has contributed in one or more branches of philosophy, such as aesthetics, ethics, epistemology, logic, metaphysics, social theory, and political philosophy. A philosopher may also be one who worked in the humanities or other sciences which have since split from philosophy proper over the centuries, such as the arts, history, economics, sociology, psychology, linguistics, anthropology, theology, and politics. 

History

Ancient Greece and Rome

The separation of philosophy and science from theology began in Greece during the 6th century BC.  Thales, an astronomer and mathematician, was considered by Aristotle to be the first philosopher of the Greek tradition. 

While Pythagoras coined the word, the first known elaboration on the topic was conducted by Plato. In his Symposium, he concludes that Love is that which lacks the object it seeks. Therefore, the philosopher is one who seeks wisdom; if he attains wisdom, he would be a sage. Therefore, the philosopher in antiquity was one who lives in the constant pursuit of wisdom, and living in accordance to that wisdom.  Disagreements arose as to what living philosophically entailed. These disagreements gave rise to different Hellenistic schools of philosophy. In consequence, the ancient philosopher thought in a tradition.  As the ancient world became schism by philosophical debate, the competition lay in living in manner that would transform his whole way of living in the world. 

Among the last of these philosophers was Marcus Aurelius, who is widely regarded as a philosopher in the modern sense, but personally refused to call himself by such a title, since he had a duty to live as an emperor. 

Transition

According to the Classicist Pierre Hadot, the modern conception of a philosopher and philosophy developed predominately through three changes:

The first is the natural inclination of the philosophical mind. Philosophy is a tempting discipline which can easily carry away the individual in analyzing the universe and abstract theory. 

The second is the historical change through the Medieval era. With the rise of Christianity, the philosophical way of life was adopted by its theology. Thus, philosophy was divided between a way of life and the conceptual, logical, physical and metaphysical materials to justify that way of life. Philosophy was then the servant to theology.Pierre Hadot, Philosophy as a Way of Life, trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. pg. 32: Introduction: Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy by Arnold I. Davidson.

The third is the sociological need with the development of the university. The modern university requires professionals to teach. Maintaining itself requires teaching future professionals to replace the current faculty. Therefore, the discipline degrades into a technical language reserved for specialists, completely eschewing its original conception as a way of life.

Medieval era

In the fourth century, the word philosopher began to designate a man or woman who led a monastic life. Gregory of Nyssa, for example, describes how his sister Macrina persuaded their mother to forsake "the distractions of material life" for a life of philosophy. 

Later during the Middle Ages, persons who engaged with alchemy was called a philosopher - thus, the Philosopher's Stone. 

Early Modern era

Many philosophers still emerged from the Classical tradition, as saw their philosophy as a way of life. Among the most notable are René Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, Nicolas Malebranche, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. With the rise of the university, the modern conception of philosophy became more prominent. Many of the esteemed philosophers of the eighteenth century and onward have attended, taught, and developed their works in university. Early examples include: Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. 

After these individuals, the Classical conception had all but died with the exceptions of Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche. The last considerable figure in philosophy to not have followed a strict and orthodox academic regime was Ludwig Wittgenstein. 

Modern academia

In the modern era, those attaining advanced degrees in philosophy often choose to stay in careers within the educational system. According to a 1993 study by the National Research Council (as reported by the American Philosophical Association), 77.1% of the 7,900 holders of a Ph.D. in philosophy who responded were employed in educational institutions (academia). Outside of academia, philosophers may employ their writing and reasoning skills in other careers, such as medicine, bioethics, business, publishing, free-lance writing, media, and law.

Prizes in philosophy

Various prizes in philosophy exist. Among the most prominent are:
*Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy
*Rolf Schock Prizes
*Avicenna Prize

Certain esteemed philosophers, such as Henri Bergson, Bertrand Russell, Albert Camus, and Jean-Paul Sartre, have also won the Nobel Prize in Literature.

The John W. Kluge Prize for the Study of Humanity, created by the Library of Congress to recognize work not covered by the Nobel Prizes, was given to philosophers Leszek Kołakowski in 2003, Paul Ricoeur in 2004, and Jürgen Habermas and Charles Taylor in 2015.

444 Club | Susquehanna Greenway
444 Club | Susquehanna Greenway
February 2014
Story by Rick Hiduk, courtesy of EMHR.
Few activities beat the serenity that a paddle on the Susquehanna River can provide. In just three months, the ice will have cleared from the 444-mile waterway that is part of the National Park System, and paddlers and fishers will once again set in for much-anticipated recreation. For paddlers who have traversed all or most of the North Branch and main stem of the river, a newly created 444 Club pin is great way to acknowledge a journey that is often years in the making.
Avid paddlers of the Susquehanna River have long marked their progress at traversing the 444 miles of the North Branch that flows through Pennsylvania and covers smaller portions of New York and Maryland. Many have highlighted completed sections of the river on maps, kept notes on journals, or recorded their journeys with photos and video clips.
The new 444 Club was initiated by the Endless Mountains Heritage Region (EMHR) Water Trails Committee to acknowledge those individual's efforts as they seek the elusive benchmark.
Endless Mountain Outfitters (EMO) owner and EMHR board member David Buck credits lifetime recreationists like Cindy Dunn, Rick Shumaker, Scott Arnold, and inaugural 444 member Bill Gibson for suggesting the formation of the club, as well as Judy Lorincz of Mehoopany, who completed her 444 Club personal goal of paddling the entire river a few years ago. A number of people notched some of the 444 miles last year after paddling with EMO from Great Bend, PA through Binghamton, NY to the French Azilum Historic Site in Bradford County.
Dunn is one of those who thinks that the formation of the 444 Club will provide an incentive to get new paddlers on the river and bring long-time recreationists back to the waterway. "This is a great idea that makes me want to paddle the whole 444 again," she remarked, noting that her first week-long sojourn on the Susquehanna began on the North Branch. "That is where I got totally hooked on the Susquehanna," Dunn related.
For Dunn and many other like her, paddling the Susquehanna River is a spiritual experience. "Look up at the Wyalusing cliffs from my canoe, I half expected to see an American Indian," she stated, The portal to pre-European settlement makes her wonder "How many Indians gazed at the river from this vantage?" and "What did the landscape look like then?"
Dunn's favorite stretch of the river is the Vosburg Neck in Wyoming County, with sharp cliffs on one side and verdant forest on the other. "I never fail to hear lots of bird song when I paddle through here," she related, adding that she has seen several Eagles in the Vosburg area.
The winding river is almost addictive, Dunn explains. During her sojourn through the Endless Mountains, "the views were so enticing as I paddled down each reach." She had to know what was around the next bend.
It is hoped that members who receive the pins will be able to provide guidance to recreationists following in their wake as each plans to tackle new stretches of the river, which meanders along the borderline of New York and Pennsylvania before running from the Endless Mountains through Pennsylvania to the Chesapeake Bay near Havre de Grace, MD.

A Year in Provence
A Year in Provence is a 1989 best-selling memoir by Peter Mayle about his first year in Provence, and the local events and customs.  It was adapted into a television mini-series starring John Thaw and Lindsay Duncan. Reviewers praised the book's honest style, wit[http://french.about.com/library/reviews/aafpr-yearinprovence.htm A Year in Provence, by Peter Mayle] and its refreshing humour.  The book was turned into an equally popular radio version.

Plot

Peter Mayle and his wife move to Provence, and are soon met with unexpectedly fierce weather, underground truffle dealers and unruly workers, who work around their normalement schedule.  Meals in Provençal restaurants and work on the Mayles' house, garden and vineyard are features of the book, whose chapters follow the months of the year.

Mini-series

In 1993, the BBC produced a television mini-series based on the book, starring Lindsay Duncan and John Thaw, with appearances from Alfred Molina and James Fleet amongst others. Unlike the book, the miniseries was
not well received by critics; A Year in Provence was later placed at number ten on a Radio Times list of 
the worst television programs ever made   
  with the writer, John Naughton, describing
it as the ""smugathon" series A Year In Provence " and stated it "achieved the near impossible - creating a John Thaw vehicle nobody liked".

Shiv now most capped West Indies Test player
WICB Press Release - Wednesday, July 6th, 2011 at 1:23 PM
Chanderpaul
Roseau, Dominica – Shivnarine Chanderpaul celebrated another special milestone in his outstanding career on Wednesday when he appeared in his 133rd Test match, to become the most capped West Indies Test cricketer. The 36-year-old left-hander is in the line-up for the Third Digicel Test match against India – the first ever Test at Windsor Park.
Chanderpaul made his Test debut as a 19-year-old back in 1994 and has been a reliable member of the team since then. He surpassed fast bowling great Courtney Walsh, who made 132 Test appearances. Third on the West Indies all-time list is another legend Brian Lara, who played 131 Tests.
Before the start of the match Chanderpaul was congratulated by the entire team at a brief ceremony in front the Billy Doctrove Pavilion and was also cheered by the spectators. Also, to mark the occasion, Chanderpaul presented first Test caps to debutants Kieran Powell and Kirk Edwards.
Chanderpaul was delighted. “It feels good to reach this landmark. I just want to keep doing my best in every match.”
West Indies Team Manager Richie Richardson and Batting Consultant Desmond Haynes were both members of the team when Chanderpaul played his first Test against England at Bourda in Guyana more than 17 years ago.
“This is a tremendous milestone, he has done very well and to reach 133 Test matches is truly remarkable,”  Haynes said in paying tribute.
Richardson added: “When Shiv first came into the team years back you could see the desire to play for a long time. He has worked hard over the years and it is great to see him reaching this landmark.”
Chanderpaul has had an outstanding career, scoring 9228 runs at an average of 48.56 with 22 centuries before Wednesday.

Passage:
Tail
The tail is the section at the rear end of an animal's body; in general, the term refers to a distinct, flexible appendage to the torso. It is the part of the body that corresponds roughly to the sacrum and coccyx in mammals, reptiles, and birds. While tails are primarily a feature of vertebrates, some invertebrates including scorpions and springtails, as well as snails and slugs, have tail-like appendages that are sometimes referred to as tails. Tailed objects are sometimes referred to as "caudate" and the part of the body associated with or proximal to the tail are given the adjective "caudal".

Function

Animal tails are used in a variety of ways. They provide a source of locomotion for fish and some other forms of marine life.  Many land animals use their tails to brush away flies and other biting insects.  Some species, including cats and kangaroos, use their tails for balance;   and some, such as New World monkeys and opossums, have what are known as prehensile tails, which are adapted to allow them to grasp tree branches. 

Tails are also used for social signaling. Some deer species flash the white underside of their tails to warn other nearby deer of possible danger,  beavers slap the water with their tails to indicate danger,  and canids (including domestic dogs) indicate emotions through the positioning and movement of their tails.  Some species' tails are armored, and some, such as those of scorpions, contain venom. 

Some species of lizard can detach ("cast") their tails from their bodies.  This can help them to escape predators, which are either distracted by the wriggling, detached tail or left with only the tail while the lizard flees. Tails cast in this manner generally grow back over time, though the replacement is typically darker in colour than the original. 

Most birds' tails end in long feathers called rectrices. These feathers are used as a rudder, helping the bird steer and maneuver in flight;  they also help the bird to balance while it is perched.   In some species—such as birds of paradise, lyrebirds, and most notably peafowl—modified tail feathers play an important role in courtship displays.   The extra-stiff tail feathers of other species, including woodpeckers and woodcreepers, allow them to brace themselves firmly against tree trunks. 

The tails of grazing animals, such as horses, are used both to sweep away insects and positioned or moved in ways that indicate the animal's physical or emotional state. 

Human tails

Human embryos have a tail that measures about one-sixth of the size of the embryo itself.  As the embryo develops into a fetus, the tail is absorbed by the growing body. Infrequently, a child is born with a ’"soft tail", which contains no vertebrae, but only blood vessels, muscles, and nerves, but this is regarded as an abnormality rather than a vestigial true tail, even when such an appendage is located where the tail would be expected.  

Humans have a "tail bone" (the coccyx) attached to the pelvis, formed of fused vertebrae, usually four, at the bottom of the vertebral column. It does not protrude externally.

Product Description
The Sex Museum, Amsterdam Nobody thought it would make any money when the Sex Museum opened its doors in 1985. For the first few weeks, admission was actually free. Today, however, some 500,000 visitors to Amsterdam enter the museum every year. Perhaps it was a good omen when two ancient objects of an erotic nature turned up in the soil during excavation for the building of the museum. One of them was a cracked tile on which a card-playing man was depicted sporting an evident erection - maybe betraying the excitement of a winner. The other was a small statuette of the Greek god Hermes with a giant tumescence, probably imported from the Mediterranean by a Dutch merchant centuries ago. In their time, such figurines were not only fertility icons but also good luck charms. At the opening of the Museum, Monique van M. may well have been the youngest museum director in Europe - young enough still to depend on the support and advice of her father. The museum's contents were not particularly numerous. All that could be taken for granted in the enterprise was public interest in the erotic, whether for historical or artistic or other reasons. Museums are meant to reflect every aspect of life and culture in Europe, yet this clearly crucial part of life remains under-represented, despite the fact that artists of cultures from all over the world have created outstanding works on the subject. Simply asking a curator where the erotic art may be found in an art museum often meets with a negative response. And in any case, erotic works tend to hit museums moral blind spot .....

Ashfield (UK Parliament constituency)
Ashfield is a Nottinghamshire constituency  represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2010 by Gloria De Piero of the Labour Party.

Constituency profile 

To date almost always a Labour Party seat which was created in 1955, Ashfield has been served by a former Secretary of State, Geoff Hoon, and since its creation for only two years has been served by one member of another party, Tim Smith of the Conservative Party, from 1977 to 1979.  Ashfield's results indicate quite large Labour majorities.  In 2010 the seat had a marginal majority of only 192, but this was increased to 8,820 in 2015.

Boundaries 

1955-1983: The Urban Districts of Hucknall, Kirkby-in-Ashfield, and Sutton-in-Ashfield, and part of the Rural District of Basford.

1983-2010: The District of Ashfield wards of Jacksdale, Kirkby-in-Ashfield Central, Kirkby-in-Ashfield East, Kirkby-in-Ashfield West, Selston, Sutton-in-Ashfield Central, Sutton-in-Ashfield East, Sutton-in-Ashfield North, Sutton-in-Ashfield West, Underwood, and Woodhouse, and the Borough of Broxtowe wards of Brinsley, Eastwood East, Eastwood North, and Eastwood South.

2010-present: The District of Ashfield wards of Jacksdale, Kirkby-in-Ashfield Central, Kirkby-in-Ashfield East, Kirkby-in-Ashfield West, Selston, Sutton-in-Ashfield Central, Sutton-in-Ashfield East, Sutton-in-Ashfield North, Sutton-in-Ashfield West, Underwood, and Woodhouse, and the Borough of Broxtowe wards of Brinsley, Eastwood North and Greasley Beauvale, and Eastwood South.

Members of Parliament 

The former Cabinet minister Geoff Hoon represented the seat for the Labour Party from 1992, when he succeeded the three-term Labour member Frank Haynes, to 2010 when he retired.  Ashfield is now represented by Gloria De Piero, who came close to losing the seat after a 17.2% swing to the Liberal Democrats in 2010 but increased her majority again in 2015.

Passage:
Nation of shopkeepers
The phrase "a nation of shopkeepers", commonly attributed to Napoleon, is a reference to England or the United Kingdom.  

There is reason to doubt that Napoleon ever used it.  No contemporaneous French newspaper mentions that he did.  The phrase was first used in an offensive sense by the French revolutionary Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac on June 11, 1794 in a speech to the National Convention: “Let Pitt then boast of his victory to his nation of shopkeepers”.   Later, during the Napoleonic wars, the British press mentioned the phrase, attributing it either to “the French” or to Napoleon himself.   

A later, explicit source is Barry Edward O'Meara, who was surgeon to Napoleon during his exile in St. Helena.   If O'Meara is to be believed, Napoleon said:

  There may be grounds to doubt the veracity of this account. 

The supposed French original as uttered by Napoleon (une nation de boutiquiers) is frequently cited, but it has no attestation.  O'Meara conversed with Napoleon in Italian, not French.  There is no other source.

After the war English newspapers sometimes tried to correct the impression.  For example the following article appeared in the Morning Post of 28 May 1832: 
ENGLAND A NATION OF SHOPKEEPERS
This complimentary term, for so we must consider it, as applied to a Nation which has derived its principal prosperity from its commercial greatness, has been erroneously attributed, from time to time, to all the leading Revolutionists of France.  To our astonishment we now find it applied exclusively to BONAPARTE.  Than this nothing can be further from the fact.  NAPOLEON was scarcely known at the time, he being merely an Officer of inferior rank, totally unconnected with politics.  The occasion on which that splenetic, but at the same time, complimentary observation was made was that of the ever-memorable battle of the 1st of June.  The oration delivered on that occasion was by M. BARRERE [sic], in which, after describing our beautiful country as one "on which the sun scarce designs to shed its light", he described England as a nation of shopkeepers.

In any case the phrase did not originate with Napoleon, or even Barère.  It first appears in a non-pejorative sense in The Wealth of Nations (1776) by Adam Smith, who wrote: 

Smith is also quoted as saying that Britain was "a nation that is governed by shopkeepers", which is how he put it in the first (1776) edition.  It is unlikely that either Adam Smith or Napoleon used the phrase to describe that class of small retailers who would not even have had the franchise.

The phrase may have been part of standard 18th century economic dialogue.  It has been suggested that Napoleon may have heard it during a meeting of the French Convention on 11 June 1794, when Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac quoted Smith's phrase.   But this presupposes that Napoleon himself, as opposed to Barère alone, used the phrase.

The phrase has also been attributed to Samuel Adams, but this is disputed; Josiah Tucker, Dean of Gloucester, produced a slightly different phrase in 1766:

Napoleon would have been correct in seeing the United Kingdom as essentially a commercial and naval rather than a land based power, but during his lifetime  it was fast being transformed from a mercantile to an industrial nation, a process which laid the basis for a century of British hegemony after the Battle of Waterloo.  Although the UK had half the population of France during the Napoleonic Wars,  there was a higher per capita income and, consequently, a greater tax base, necessary to conduct a prolonged war of attrition.  The United Kingdom's economy and its ability to finance the war against Napoleon also benefitted from the Bank of England's issuance of inconvertible banknotes, a "temporary" measure which remained from the 1790s until 1821.

Britannia Coco-nut Dancers
The Britannia Coco-nut Dancers or Nutters are a troupe of Lancastrian clog dancers who perform every Easter in Bacup, dancing 7 mi across the town.  There are eight dancers and a whipper-in, who controls the proceedings.

History

Some say the custom was brought to the area by Moors who settled in Cornwall in the 17th century, became miners and then moved to work in quarries in Lancashire.  Similar dances – the Danse des Coco –  are performed in Provence.   This troupe was formed as the Tunstead Mill Nutters in 1857 when it was one of a group of five which performed in the Rossendale valley. According to the Burnley Gazette, a man named Abraham Spencer (1842–1918) was one of the founders back in 1857, at only 15. They passed on their tradition to workers at the Britannia Mill in the 1920s.  Their dances feature floral hoops or garlands; the musical accompaniment is provided by a concertina or the Stacksteads Silver Band.

Costume

Their name refers to the wooden nuts worn at their knees, waists and wrists, which are made from the tops of bobbins.   These are taped together like castanets as a percussive accompaniment to the dance, the nuts on the hands striking the nuts on the waist or knees in an intricate and dextrous rhythm.   They wear white turbans with blue plumes, dark jerseys and trews, a white baldric, red and white skirts, white hose and black clogs.  

Blackface

Their faces are blackened.  This is popularly explained as either due to the origins of the dance in the mining community,  a reference to the dancers' ancient origin as Barbary pirates or as a disguise to ward off evil spirits.  Theresa Buckland's (1990) research discusses the linkages between the tradition and minstrel shows.  She argued, "The 'disguise' function of the costume has most likely been influences by Cecil Sharp's [1911] interpretation of the black face [...] which has been repeated in various publications and ephemera of the English Folk Dance and Song Society ... The dancers have been exposed to information from these publications, whether first-hand or further removed."   The issue caused controversy in 2014, when local politician Will Straw was photographed with them.  He defended the custom: "... it’s traditions from the past which give communities a sense of common identity for the present and the future. May the Coconutters continue for many years to come."

Membership

One long-standing member of the troupe is Dick Shufflebottom, whose service of 50 years was celebrated in 2006 and who continued as an active member in 2013, aged 76.   The youngest member of the troupe at that time was Gavin McNulty, age 26.

Performances

The main annual performance is on Easter Saturday, but rehearsals take place weekly throughout the year and form a social occasion.  
In 2013, the annual performance was threatened by public sector austerity as the police and local authority threatened to withdraw support for the traffic management and security at the event. 

Reviews

AA Gill, writing in The Sunday Times, described them as bizarrely compelling:  

Recordings 

A five-minute black-and-white film, shot in 1930, with a new musical accompaniment, is included in the DVD Here's a Health to the Barley Mow, issued by the BFI in 2011. 

An 2-minute and 18-second excerpt of the music used for the dancing, recorded in 1972, is included on the album The Voice of the People, Volume 16: You Lazy Lot of Bone Shakers – Songs & Dance Tunes of Seasonal Events, issued by Topic Records.   Topic included this recording as Track One on the second CD in their 70-year anniversary boxed set Three Score and Ten.
