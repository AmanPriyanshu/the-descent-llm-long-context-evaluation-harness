Geography
Hong          Kong island sits just south of the Tropic of Cancer on similar latitudes          as Calcutta, Havana, and Hawaii, and sharing the same longitude as Wuhan          in central China, Bali, and Perth. Surrounding the country's southern          coast is the South China Sea.
The country consists of a peninsular protruding from southeastern China and hundreds          of islands scattered off the coast. Kowloon and the New Territories make          up the peninsular, while south off the mainland is Hong Kong Island and          various other remote islands.
Deep waters          surround Hong Kong, and with its wide harbors protected by mountains in          the north and south, the region is favorable as a passing point for ships.          Its geographical location between the Taiwan Straits, the South China          Sea, and the Pacific Ocean make it a strategic channel for sea traffic          in Asia and the world.
Size
Hong Kong          is a small-sized island covering 1,095 sq. km (423 sq. miles). However,          there are currently many reclamation projects at hand, thus expanding          the land area. Hong Kong never used to be as big as it is now. From 1851          to 1997, the total area of land reclaimed from the sea measured to 60          sq. km (23 sq. miles). In area, the island of Hong Kong is 80 sq. km (31          sq. miles), Kowloon peninsular is 47 sq. km (18 sq. miles), the New Territories          is 794 sq. km (306 sq. miles), and the remote islands total 175 sq. km          (67 sq. miles).
Topography
Hong Kong          stands on volcanic terra firma, with its landscape dominated by hills          and mountains. A crest lining from the northeast to southwest forms the          backbone of Hong Kong. Kowloon peninsular and the northwestern New Territories          are mainly flat areas. Three percent of Hong Kong's total land area is          agriculturally cultivated and this is mostly at the New Territories large          alluvial plains.
A narrow          piece of flat land between the mountains and the sea along the north shore          in Hong Kong is vacated by most of the country's population, whereas the          south shore has luxury residential buildings and some nice beaches, such          as Stanley and Repulse Bays. There is a tunnel that was built through          the mountains, which links the north and south shores.
The highest          peak is Ta Mo Shan, located in central New Territories at 957 meters (3,140          ft) above sea level, while the lowest is Lo Chau Mun at 66 meters (217ft).          Victoria Peak, or 'The Peak', is only 552 meters (1,811ft) but its spectacular          view of Victoria Harbour, Kowloon, and the Central and Wan Chai strip          of Hong Kong Island has made an international reputation for itself.
In total,          there are about 234 outlying islands in the country, with the island of          Hong Kong being the most famous and populated. Even then, Hong Kong is          not reputed to be the largest island around. Lantau Island is by far the          biggest of Hong Kong's islands. It has now surfaced from its remoteness          to becoming the site of the new, high-tech Chek Lap Kok international          airport.
Although          Hong Kong dwells on volcanic plains, there are only minor seismic activities,          occasionally causing tremors. To date, no major earthquakes have been          reported, but the last that occurred in the region was back in 1874, with          a magnitude of 5.75 on the Richter scale, which caused only minor damages.
Climate
Hong Kong          has a subtropical climate because of the wide temperature range and cooler          winters. Even though Hong Kong's latitude is within the tropics, its seasonal          changes are greater than in most places at similar latitudes. Monsoons          and seasonal alternation of winds often dominate the climatic system of          the country.
Spring occurs          in the months of March to the middle of May. Temperature rises ranges          from 18� to 27�C (64�-80� F) and humidity averages up to 77 percent. Some,          with fog, constant rain and showers, and only a few moments of sunshine,          consider the transitional period from winter to summer miserable. The          average annual rainfall is 2,200 millimeters, with about 80 percent of          the total falling occurring at this period. Higher statures, such as west          of the New Territories and the southern islands, receive more rainfall          than any other areas.
From June          to mid September, summer takes over. The weather becomes hot and humid,          with temperatures ranging from 26� to 33�C (78�-91�F) and humidity level          at above 86 percent. It is advisable to always carry an umbrella or to          wear a hat to shield against intense sunshine.
The best          times to visit Hong Kong would be during autumn and winter when the air          is dry and cool. These times are between the months of mid September to          February. In autumn, clear sunny days are usually expected and temperatures          range from 18� to 28�C (64�-82�F). Humidity averages 72 percent. Winter,          on the other hand, starts from mid December to February. January is normally          the coldest month. Temperatures can drop from 20�C to about 10�C (50�F),          with occasional chills.
Visitors          to Hong Kong during the monsoon period should be wary and prepared with          umbrellas at all times. Dress warmly, or carry along a jacket or sweater          just in case there is a sudden change in weather.

Passage:
Juliet (moon)
There is also an asteroid called 1285 Julietta.

Juliet (  or ) is an inner satellite of Uranus. It was discovered from the images taken by Voyager 2 on 3 January 1986, and was given the temporary designation S/1986 U 2. It is named after the heroine of William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. It is also designated Uranus XI.

Juliet belongs to Portia Group of satellites, which also includes Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Portia, Rosalind, Cupid, Belinda and Perdita. These satellites have similar orbits and photometric properties. Unfortunately, other than its orbit, radius of 53 km and geometric albedo of 0.08 virtually nothing is known about Juliet.

At the Voyager 2 images Juliet appears as an elongated object, the major axis pointing towards Uranus. The ratio of axes of Juliet's prolate spheroid is 0.5 ± 0.3, which is rather an extreme value. Its surface is grey in color.

Juliet may collide with Desdemona within the next 100 million years.
Question:
Juliet, Cupid and Desdemona are moons of which planet?
Answer:
Magnetosphere of Uranus

2014 Tour de France
The 2014 Tour de France was the 101st edition of the Tour de France. It started on 5 July in Leeds, United Kingdom, and concluded on 27 July in Paris, France.    As is traditionally the case in even-numbered years, it followed a clockwise route through France. Italian cyclist Vincenzo Nibali won the race by more than seven minutes, the biggest winning margin since 1997.  

Teams

All 18 teams in the UCI's Proteam category were entitled, and obliged, to enter the race.  Four UCI Professional Continental teams were also invited. 

Before the start of the race, Chris Froome, Alberto Contador, and Vincenzo Nibali were among the favourites for overall victory.   Froome crashed out of the Tour on stage 5, and Contador followed on stage 10, after breaking his leg in a crash. German rider Jens Voigt competed in his seventeenth and final Tour. 

Grand Départ

The Grand Départ team presentation took place on 3 July in Leeds at the First Direct Arena, after a ceremonial ride from the University of Leeds. The ceremony included performances from Embrace and Opera North. 

Route and stages

The first three stages were in the United Kingdom, starting in Leeds.   This was the fourth Tour de France to contain stages in the United Kingdom (after 1974, 1994 and 2007) and the first edition to contain more than two stages there.

Classification leadership

There are four main individual classifications contested in the 2014 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important is the general classification, which is calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time is the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification will be considered the winner of the Tour.  In 2014, there are no time bonuses given.

The points classification awards a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists get points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points leads the classification, and is identified with a green jersey.

The mountains classification is a special points competition awarded to those riders who climb the most difficult ascents the fastest. The organisation categorises some climbs as either hors catégorie, first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification are won by the first cyclists that reach the top of these climbs, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The rider with the most mountain points is awarded a polka dot jersey. There were also two special awards, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange given to first rider over the highest climb in the Tour and the Souvenir Jacques Goddet, given to the first rider to pass his memorial on the Col du Tourmalet. They did not award any points for the mountains classification, but gave a cash prize of €5000. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange this year was on the Col d'Izoard in stage 14, and was claimed by Joaquim Rodríguez and the Souvenir Jacques Goddet was won by Blel Kadri on stage 18.

The young rider classification, denoted by a white jersey, is calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification is restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1989.

The team classification is calculated using the finishing times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage; the leading team is the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that lead this classification are identified with yellow numbers and helmets.

In addition, there is a combativity award, given after each stage to the cyclist considered to be the most combative rider that day; it is awarded by a jury vote.  The winner wears red numbers on the back of his jersey the following day. At the conclusion of the Tour de France, the cyclist who has received the most total votes across all stages is recognized as the most combative rider of the entire Tour.

* In stage 2, Bryan Coquard, who was third in the points classification, wore the green jersey, because Marcel Kittel (in first place) wore the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification  and Peter Sagan (in second place) wore the white jersey as leader of the young riders' classification during that stage
* In stages 3–5, Romain Bardet, who was second in the young riders' classification, wore the white jersey, because Peter Sagan (in first place) wore the green jersey as leader of the points classification. Also, in stages 6–7, Michał Kwiatkowski wore the white jersey for the same reason.
* In stage 14, Joaquim Rodríguez, who was second in the mountains classification, wore the polka-dot jersey, because Vincenzo Nibali (in first place) wore the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification.

Passage:
Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis
The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis is the head of London's Metropolitan Police Service, classing the holder as a chief police officer. The post is currently held by Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe after his appointment by the Queen on 12 September 2011.  

The Commissioner is regarded as the highest ranking police officer in the United Kingdom, despite the fact that his authority is generally confined to the Metropolitan Police Service's area of operation, Greater London. However, unlike other police forces the Metropolitan Police has certain national responsibilities such as leading counter-terrorism policing and the protection of the Royal Family and senior members of Her Majesty's Government. Furthermore, the postholder is directly accountable to the Home Secretary and the public nationally amongst many others (the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime, the Mayor of London, Londoners) whereas smaller police forces are only accountable to residents and their local Police and Crime Commissioner or police authority.   
The rank is usually referred to as the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, the Met Commissioner or simply just "Commissioner". The Commissioner's annual salary without pension contributions or allowances from 1 September 2010, is £260,088. 

History

The rank of Commissioner was created by the Metropolitan Police Act 1829; until 1855, the post was held jointly by two officers. The Commissioners were Justices of the Peace and not sworn constables until 1 April 1974.  The title Commissioner was not used until 1839.

The insignia of rank is a crown above a Bath Star, known as "pips", above crossed tipstaves within a wreath, very similar to the insignia worn by a full general in the British Army. This badge is all but unique within the British police, shared only with the Commissioner of the City of London Police, the smallest territorial police force, and HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary. Like all chief officer ranks in the British police, commissioners wear gorget patches on the collars of their tunics. The gorget patches are similar to those worn by generals, aside from being of silver-on-black instead of the Army's gold-on-red. 

At one time, the commissioners were either retired military officers or civil servants. Sir John Nott-Bower, who served as Commissioner from 1953 to 1958, was the first career police officer to hold the post, despite several previous Commissioners having served in senior administrative positions in colonial forces, and the Metropolitan Police itself.  Nott-Bower's successor Sir Joseph Simpson was the first Commissioner to have started his career as the lowest rank of Constable. However, Sir Robert Mark, appointed in 1972, was the first to have risen through all the ranks from the lowest to the highest, as all his successors have done.

, the post of Commissioner is appointed for a period of five years. Applicants are appointed to the post by Her Majesty The Queen, following a recommendation by the Home Secretary under the Police Act 1996.

As of 2010 the salary of the Commissioner of the Metropolis is £260,088. 

Eligibility and accountability

, applicants to the post of Commissioner must be British citizens, and be "serving UK chief constables or of equivalent UK ranks and above, or have recent experience at these levels". The post of Commissioner is "accountable to the Home Secretary; to the MPA, chaired by the Mayor of London; and must answer to Londoners and the public nationally." 

This requirement to be a British national has blocked the appointment of non-British Commissioners in the past. In August 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron wanted former Los Angeles Police Department Chief Bill Bratton to become the new Met Police Commissioner, but this was blocked by the Home Office pointing out that the Commissioner has to be British.  , the requirement is set to be scrapped by a proposal made by the Chief Inspector of Constabulary.

Passage:
The Hay Wain
The Hay Wain is a painting by John Constable, finished in 1821, which depicts a rural scene on the River Stour between the English counties of Suffolk and Essex. It hangs in the National Gallery in London and is regarded as "Constable's most famous image"  and one of the greatest and most popular English paintings.

Painted in oils on canvas, the work depicts as its central feature three horses pulling a hay wain or large farm cart across the river. Willy Lott's Cottage, also the subject of an eponymous painting by Constable, is visible on the far left. The scene takes place near Flatford Mill in Suffolk, though since the Stour forms the border of two counties, the left bank is in Suffolk and the landscape on the right bank is in Essex.

The Hay Wain is one of a series of paintings by Constable called the "six-footers", large-scale canvasses which he painted for the annual summer exhibitions at the Royal Academy. As with all of the paintings in this series Constable produced a full-scale oil sketch for the work; this is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Constable originally exhibited the finished work with the title Landscape: Noon, suggesting that he envisaged it as belonging to the classical landscape tradition of representing the cycles of nature.

History

Flatford Mill was owned by Constable's father. The house on the left side of the painting belonged to a neighbour, Willy Lott, a tenant farmer, who was said to have been born in the house and never to have left it for more than four days in his lifetime. Willy Lott's Cottage has survived to this day practically unaltered, but none of the trees in the painting exist today.

Although The Hay Wain is revered today as one of the greatest British paintings, when it was originally exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1821 (under the title Landscape: Noon), it failed to find a buyer. 

It was considerably better received in France where it was praised by Théodore Géricault. The painting caused a sensation when it was exhibited with other works by Constable at the 1824 Paris Salon (it has been suggested that the inclusion of Constable's paintings in the exhibition was a tribute to Géricault, who died early that year). In that exhibition, The Hay Wain was singled out for a gold medal awarded by Charles X of France, a cast of which is incorporated into the picture's frame. The works by Constable in the exhibition inspired a new generation of French painters, including Eugène Delacroix.

Sold at the exhibition with three other Constables to the dealer John Arrowsmith, The Hay Wain was brought back to England by another dealer, D. T. White; he sold it to a Mr Young who resided in Ryde on the Isle of Wight. It was there that the painting came to the attention of the collector Henry Vaughan and the painter Charles Robert Leslie.  On the death of his friend Mr Young, Vaughan bought the painting from the former's estate; in 1886 he presented it to the National Gallery in London, where it still hangs today.  In his will Vaughan bequeathed the full-scale oil sketch for The Hay Wain, made with a palette knife, to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum). 

The Hay Wain was voted the second most popular painting in any British gallery, second only to Turner's Fighting Temeraire, in a 2005 poll organised by BBC Radio 4's Today programme. On 28 June 2013 a protester, reported to be connected with Fathers4Justice, glued a photograph of a young boy to the painting while it was on display at the National Gallery. The work was not permanently damaged.

Whose cottage is on the left of the Constable painting The Hay Wain?

Passage:
Apostle spoon
An apostle spoon is a spoon (usually silver or silver-plated, but sometimes of other metals, such as pewter) with an image of an apostle or other saint as the termination of the handle, each bearing his distinctive emblem. Apostle spoons were particularly popular in Pre-Reformation times when belief in the services of a patron saint was still strong. They symbolize the Last Supper of Christ in the company of the Apostles. Apostle spoons were especially popular in England, but were also found in large numbers in Germany. Fleming, John & Hugh Honour. (1977) The Penguin Dictionary of Decorative Arts.  London: Allen Lane, p. 27. ISBN 0713909412

Origins

Originating in early-fifteenth century in Europe as spoons used at table (often produced in sets of thirteen, the thirteenth, showing Jesus, usually being referred to as the 'Saviour' or 'Master' spoon). The British Museum in London has a set from England dating from 1536–7 which has a figure of the Virgin Mary on the thirteenth spoon.  By the sixteenth century they had become popular as baptismal presents for godchildren, but were dying out by the 1660s.  In some communities this tradition continued until at least the mid-twentieth century.

They first appeared as a bequest in the will of one Amy Brent who, in 1516,  bequeathed "XIII sylver spones of J' hu and the XII Apostells." They are alluded to by the dramatists Ben Johnson, Thomas Middleton, Francis Beaumont, and John Fletcher. Shakespeare refers to it in Henry VIII, Act 5, Scene 3, where Cranmer declines to be sponsor for the infant Elizabeth because of his lack of money. King Henry banters him with "Come, come, my lord, you'ld spare your spoons." 

Sets of the twelve apostles are not common, and complete sets of thirteen, with the figure of Jesus on a larger spoon, are still rarer.

The spoon shown opposite is typical of single spoons not part of a set.  In this case the apostle is simply holding what appears to be a book. Such examples would typically be in electroplated nickel silver and marked on the rear face with "EPNS."

Attributes

Apostle spoons can be known by the attribute mentioned in the following list:

*1 the Master: cross and orb 
*2 Saint Peter: a sword or a key, sometimes a fish
*3 Saint Andrew: a cross
*4 Saint James the Greater: a pilgrim's staff
*5 St. John: the cup of sorrow
*6 Saint Philip: a staff
*7 Saint Bartholomew: a knife
*8 Saint Thomas: a spar
*9 Saint Matthew: an axe or halbert
*10 Saint James the Lesser: a fuller's bat
*11 Saint Jude: a carpenter's set square
*12 Saint Simon Zealotes: a long saw
*13 Judas Iscariot: a bag of money

Passage:
Doi Inthanon
Doi Inthanon ( ([http://www.forvo.com/word/doi_inthanon/ pronunciation])) is the highest mountain in Thailand.  It is in Chom Thong District, Chiang Mai Province. This mountain is an ultra prominent peak, known in the past as Doi Luang (meaning "big mountain") or Doi Ang Ka, meaning the "crow's pond top". Near the mountain's base was a pond where many crows gathered. The name Doi Inthanon was given in honour of King Inthawichayanon, one of the last kings of Chiang Mai, who was concerned about the forests in the north and tried to preserve them. He ordered that after his death his remains be interred at Doi Luang, which was then renamed in his honour.

Today, the summit of Doi Inthanon is a popular tourist destination for both foreign and Thai tourists, with a peak of 12,000 visitors visiting the summit on New Year's Day. In addition to a range of tourist facilities on the summit, there is also a Royal Thai Air Force weather radar station at the summit and the Thai National Observatory (TNO) at km44. 

Geography

Doi Inthanon is the highest peak of the Inthanon Range () of the Thanon Thong Chai Range, a subrange of the Shan Hills in the Thai highlands stretching southwards from the Daen Lao Range. This range, the southwesternmost of the Shan Highland system, separates the Salween watershed from the Mekong watershed. Other high peaks of the Loi Lar Mountain Range are Doi Luang Chiang Dao (2,175 m), Doi Pui (1,685 m), and Doi Suthep (1,601 m).

In 1954, the forests around Doi Inthanon were conserved, creating Doi Inthanon National Park, as one of the original 14 national parks of Thailand.  This park now covers 482.4 km² and spreads from the lowlands at 800 m elevation up to the peak at 2,565 m. Given the varied climatic and ecological areas regions, the park supports a range of animal species, including over 360 bird species.

On the lower slopes of Doi Inthanon, near the Karen hill tribe village, Ban Sop Had, are the Wachirathan waterfalls (), where the Wachirathan (lit. "Diamond Creek") tumbles over a granite escarpment.

Climate 

The climate is typically tropical and fairly cool on the summit of Doi Inthanon. In winter the average temperature is 6 °C (43 °F) in January and temperatures can sometimes drop below 0 °C (32 °F). From March to June, temperatures are pleasant especially at higher altitudes. The rainy season runs from April to November, sometimes it rains often more than 2 hours per day.

The two chedis

On the main road to the summit of Doi Inthanon stand two adjacent chedis, one called Naphamethinidon (นภเมทินีดล), meaning "by the strength of the land and air", and the other, Naphaphonphumisiri (นภพลภูมิสิริ), meaning "being the strength of the air and the grace of the land". These temples were built to honour the 60th birthday anniversary of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in 1987, and the 60th birthday anniversary of Queen Sirikit in 1992, respectively.

Geology

Geologically the mountain is a granite batholith in a north-south oriented mountain range. The second-highest peak of this range is Doi Hua Mot Luang at 2,340 m.

Passage:
Heptathlon
A heptathlon is a track and field combined events contest made up of seven events. The name derives from the Greek hepta (seven) and athlon (contest). A competitor in a heptathlon is referred to as a heptathlete.

There are two heptathlons – the women's heptathlon and the men's – composed of different events. The men's heptathlon is older and is held indoors, while the women's is held outdoors and was introduced in the 1980s, first appearing in the Olympics in 1984.

Women's heptathlon

Women's heptathlon is the combined event for women contested in the Athletics program of the Olympics and in the IAAF World Championships in Athletics. The IAAF World Combined Events Challenge determines a yearly women's heptathlon champion. The women's outdoor heptathlon consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day, and the remaining three on day two:

* 100 metres hurdles
* High jump
* Shot put
* 200 metres
* Long jump
* Javelin throw 
* 800 metres

The heptathlon has been contested by female athletes since the early 1980s, when it replaced the pentathlon as the primary women's combined event contest (the javelin throw and 800 m were added).  It was first contested at the Olympic level in the 1984 Summer Olympics. In recent years some women's decathlon competitions have been conducted, consisting of the same events as the men's competition in a slightly different order, and the IAAF has begun keeping records for it, but the heptathlon remains the championship-level combined event for women. Jessica Ennis-Hill, representing Great Britain, is the 2012 Olympic Gold Medallist and the current World Champion.

There is also a Tetradecathlon, which is a double heptathlon, consisting of 14 events, seven events per day.

Points system

The heptathlon scoring system was devised by Dr Karl Ulbrich, a Viennese mathematician. The formulae are constructed so that, for each event, a designated "standard" performance (for example, approximately 1.82 m for the high jump) scores 1000 points.  Each event also has a minimum recordable performance level (e.g. 0.75 m for the high jump), corresponding to zero points. The formulae are devised so that successive constant increments in performance correspond to gradually increasing increments in points awarded.

The events are split into three groups, and the scores are calculated according to the three formulae: 

Running events (200 m, 800 m and 100 m hurdles):
:P = a \cdot (b - T)^c
Jumping events (high jump and long jump):
:P = a \cdot (M - b)^c
Throwing events (shot put and javelin):
:P = a \cdot (D - b)^c

P is for points, T is for time in seconds, M is for height or length in centimeters and D is length in meters. a, b and c have different values for each of the events (see table).

Benchmarks

The following table shows the benchmark levels required to earn 1000 points in each event of the heptathlon:

Women's world records compared to heptathlon bests

Men's heptathlon

 

The other version is an indoor competition, normally contested by men only. It is the men's combined event in the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics. The men's indoor heptathlon consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day, and remaining three on day two:

* 60 metres
* long jump
* shot put
* high jump
* 60 metres hurdles
* pole vault
* 1000 metres

The scoring is similar for both versions. In each event, the athlete scores points for his/her performance in each event according to scoring tables issued by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).  The athlete accumulating the highest number of points wins the competition.

Benchmarks

The following table shows the minimum benchmark levels required to earn 1000 points in each event of the heptathlon:

Men's world records compared to heptathlon bests

Pipe Smoker of the Year
Pipe Smoker of the Year was an award given out annually by the British Pipesmokers' Council, to honour a famous pipe-smoking individual. Initiated in 1965 as Pipeman of the Year by the Briar Pipe Trade Association, it was presented at a lunch in London's Savoy Hotel each January. The award was discontinued in 2004 because its organisers feared it fell foul of laws banning all advertising and promotion of tobacco. 
The award was reintroduced in 2014, by the UK Federation of Pipe Clubs, at the British Pipe Smoking Championship at Newark Showground. In a departure from previous awards the recipient was not a celebrity, but the outgoing President of the UK Federation of Pipe Clubs Brian Mills, in recognition for his personal contribution in recommencing the British Pipe Smoking Championships.

Passage:
Khartoum Resolution
The Khartoum Resolution of September 1, 1967 was issued at the conclusion of 1967 Arab League summit convened in the wake of the Six-Day War, in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan. The summit lasted from August 29  to September 1 and was attended by eight Arab heads of state: Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Algeria, Kuwait, and Sudan.  The resolution called for: a continued state of belligerency with Israel, ending the Arab oil boycott declared during the Six-Day War, an end to the North Yemen Civil War, and economic assistance for Egypt and Jordan. It is famous for containing (in the third paragraph) what became known as the "Three No's": "no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it..." 

Text of the resolution 

#The conference has affirmed the unity of Arab states, the unity of joint action and the need for coordination and for the elimination of all differences. The Kings, Presidents and representatives of the other Arab Heads of State at the conference have affirmed their countries' stand by an implementation of the Arab Solidarity Charter which was signed at the third Arab summit conference in Casablanca.
#The conference has agreed on the need to consolidate all efforts to eliminate the effects of the aggression on the basis that the occupied lands are Arab lands and that the burden of regaining these lands falls on all the Arab States.
#The Arab Heads of State have agreed to unite their political efforts at the international and diplomatic level to eliminate the effects of the aggression and to ensure the withdrawal of the aggressive Israeli forces from the Arab lands which have been occupied since the aggression of June 5. This will be done within the framework of the main principles by which the Arab States abide, namely, no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it, and insistence on the rights of the Palestinian people in their own country.
#The conference of Arab Ministers of Finance, Economy and Oil recommended that suspension of oil pumping be used as a weapon in the battle. However, after thoroughly studying the matter, the summit conference has come to the conclusion that the oil pumping can itself be used as a positive weapon, since oil is an Arab resource which can be used to strengthen the economy of the Arab States directly affected by the aggression, so that these States will be able to stand firm in the battle. The conference has, therefore, decided to resume the pumping of oil, since oil is a positive Arab resource that can be used in the service of Arab goals. It can contribute to the efforts to enable those Arab States which were exposed to the aggression and thereby lost economic resources to stand firm and eliminate the effects of the aggression. The oil-producing States have, in fact, participated in the efforts to enable the States affected by the aggression to stand firm in the face of any economic pressure.
#The participants in the conference have approved the plan proposed by Kuwait to set up an Arab Economic and Social Development Fund on the basis of the recommendation of the Baghdad conference of Arab Ministers of Finance, Economy and Oil.
#The participants have agreed on the need to adopt the necessary measures to strengthen military preparation to face all eventualities.
#The conference has decided to expedite the elimination of foreign bases in the Arab States.

Interpretations

Commentators have frequently presented the resolution as an example of Arab rejectionism. Efraim Halevy, Guy Ben-Porat, Steven R. David, Julius Stone, and Ian Bremmer all agree the Khartoum Resolution amounted to a rejection of Israel's right to exist.      The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) itself enlisted the Khartoum Resolution to advocate against acceptance of Israel's right to exist as articulated in United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. 
Benny Morris wrote that the Arab leaders "hammered out a defiant, rejectionist platform that was to bedevil all peace moves in the region for a decade". He laid some of the blame with Israel, saying, "[i]n part [the Arab] stand was a response to Israel's unwillingness or inability to consider withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza as part of any peace settlement".  Odd Bull of the UNTSO opined in much the same manner in 1976. 

Avi Shlaim has argued that Arab spokesmen interpreted the Khartoum declarations to mean "no formal peace treaty, but not a rejection of peace; no direct negotiations, but not a refusal to talk through third parties; and no de jure recognition of Israel, but acceptance of its existence as a state" (emphasis in original). Shlaim states that the conference marked a turning point in Arab-Israeli relations, noting that Nasser urged Hussein to seek a "comprehensive settlement" with Israel. Shlaim acknowledges that none of this was known in Israel at the time, whose leaders took the "three no's" at face value. 

In the event, indirect negotiations between Israel, Jordan and Egypt eventually opened through the auspices of the Jarring Mission (1967-1973), and secret direct talks also took place between Israel and Jordan, but neither avenue succeeded in achieving a meaningful settlement, setting the stage for a new round of conflict.

Eva Stuart
Brian George Wilde (13 June 1927 – 20 March 2008) was an English actor , best known for his roles in television comedy , including Mr Barrowclough in Porridge and "Foggy" Dewhurst in Last of the Summer Wine . His lugubrious world-weary face was a staple of British television for forty years.

Career
Whilst born in Ashton-under-Lyne , Lancashire [1] , he was brought up in Devon and Hertfordshire and attended Richard Hale School . He trained as an actor at RADA . [1]
He had a small part in the horror film Night of the Demon (1957) and early television roles included the series The Love of Mike (1960) and supporting Tony Hancock in episodes of his ATV series in 1963. He also played Detective Superintendent Halcro in a series of two-part thrillers about undercover Scotland Yard officers, The Men from Room Thirteen (BBC, 1959-61). He had minor roles in films such as Life for Ruth (1962), The Bargee (1964), The Jokers (1967) and Carry On Doctor (1968), and on television in Room at the Bottom (1966-67) as Mr Salisbury. His first major television success was in 1970 as refuse depot manager "Bloody Delilah" in the ITV sitcom The Dustbinmen . He showed his sinister side as the mischievous magician Mr Peacock in the children's drama series Ace of Wands between 1970 & 1972. In 1971, he starred as a murderer in The Uninvited, an episode of the BBC's supernatural thriller series Out of the Unknown . Also in 1971, in the television drama Elizabeth R , Wilde played the efficient, merciless 'rackmaster' Richard Topcliffe, who was charged with the torture of prisoners in the Tower of London .

Porridge
Brian Wilde as prison warder Mr. Barraclough
In 1973, he starred as a different kind of gaoler in the second episode of Seven of One , a series of seven individual stories, all of which starred Ronnie Barker . In the episode, entitled "Prisoner and Escort", Wilde played Mr Barrowclough , a prison officer whose job it is to escort Barker's character Fletch across the moors to his prison. The episode proved popular and a series was commissioned by the BBC , called Porridge . Wilde reprised his role as the timid and eager-to-please Barraclough. Porridge was popular and successful; it ran until 1977, with a film version being made in 1979.
Last of the Summer Wine
Wilde established another famous role in 1976, when he took over from Michael Bates as the third member of a trio of old men in the BBC sitcom Last of the Summer Wine . The character, Walter "Foggy" Dewhurst, was a determined ex-army man who planned the group's misadventures with military precision and a painstaking eye for detail. Wilde saw the long-running series gather momentum and continue its success. He stayed with the series for 9 years before leaving in 1985, to work on other projects. Foggy was written out of the series - it was said that he had moved to Bridlington to take over the family egg painting business - and was replaced by Michael Aldridge as Seymour Utterthwaite until 1990.
When Aldridge left Last of the Summer Wine, Wilde returned as Foggy in 1990, reuniting the series' most popular and enduring line-up. Suffering from a mild infection, Wilde stood down for the first five episodes of the 1997 series in case his illness worsened. His temporary absence was covered by Frank Thornton ; Wilde himself suggested Thornton as a replacement. The filming of a Christmas Special made to introduce Thornton's character resulted in a scheduling problem that made it impossible for Wilde, who was by then fully fit, to return in that series. Producer Alan J.W. Bell said, "Since then, he has been invited to return many times, but says he feels he has 'done it now' and doesn't want to go back. I am sure that one day he will make an appearance - we still have his costume standing by," but Wilde never did return to the role.
Other works
In 1967 the BBC TV series The Avengers episode "The Fear Merchants" original air date (UK) 21 January 1967. He played Jeremy Raven a ceramics manufacturer caught up in a sinister plot to get rid of the competition. In 1988 he starred in his own BBC series, Wyatt's Watchdogs as Major Wyatt, a retired soldier, who forms his own neighbourhood watch group. As a stuffy ex-army member who leads a motley bunch of comic characters, Wyatt was quite similar to Foggy. The programme, which co-starred Trevor Bannister , was written by Miles Tredinnick and ran for one series of six episodes.
Death
Wilde suffered a fall in January 2008 from which he never recovered. He died in his sleep on the morning of 20 March 2008 at his home in Ware , Hertfordshire . [2] [3]
Tribute
In May 2009 it was announced by Danbury Mint that themselves and the BBC had agreed with the sculptor Gordon Brown that as a tribute to Brian Wilde and his Last of the Summer Wine character Foggy Dewhurst that a figurine of "Foggy" was to be produced and to be released in July 2009 and will join the "Last of the Summer Wine Collection" of 9 other figurines which include Compo, Clegg, Truly, Nora Batty, Howard, Marina, Pearl, Wally Batty and Auntie Wainwright.

Passage:
Kupffer cell
Kupffer cells, also  known as stellate macrophages and Kupffer-Browicz cells, are specialized macrophages located in the liver, lining the walls of the sinusoids that form part of the mononuclear phagocyte system.

History

The cells were first observed by Karl Wilhelm von Kupffer in 1876.  The scientist called them "Sternzellen" (star cells or hepatic stellate cell) but thought, inaccurately, that they were an integral part of the endothelium of the liver blood vessels and that they originated from it. In 1898, after several years of research, Tadeusz Browicz identified them, correctly, as macrophages.  

Development

Their development begins in the yolk sac where they differentiate into fetal macrophages. Once they enter the blood stream, they migrate to the fetal liver where they reside. There they complete their differentiation into Kupffer cells.

Function

Red blood cells are broken down by phagocytic action, where the hemoglobin molecule is split.  The globin chains are re-utilized, while the iron-containing portion, heme, is further broken down into iron, which is re-utilized, and bilirubin, which is conjugated to glucuronic acid within hepatocytes and secreted into the bile.

Helmy et al. identified a receptor present in Kupffer cells, the complement receptor of the immunoglobulin family (CRIg). Mice without CRIg could not clear complement system-coated pathogens. CRIg is conserved in mice and humans and is a critical component of the innate immune system. 

Function in alcoholic liver disease

Kupffer cell activation is responsible for early ethanol-induced liver injury, common in chronic alcoholics.  Chronic alcoholism and liver injury deal with a two hit system.  The second hit is characterized by an activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and CD14, receptors on the Kupffer cell that internalize endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide or LPS).  This activates the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tumor necrosis factor-alpha or TNFα) and production of superoxides (a pro-oxidant).  TNFα will then enter the stellate cell in the liver, leading to collagen synthesis and fibrosis.  Fibrosis will eventually cause cirrhosis, or loss of function of the liver.
Question:
Where in the body are the Kupffer Cells found?
Answer:
Impressio duodenalis
Passage:
Dunnock
The dunnock (Prunella modularis) is a small passerine, or perching bird, found throughout temperate Europe and into Asia. Dunnocks have also been successfully introduced into New Zealand. It is by far the most widespread member of the accentor family, which otherwise consists of mountain species. Other common names of the dunnock include the hedge accentor, hedge sparrow, or hedge warbler. The name "dunnock" comes from the Ancient British *dunnākos, meaning "little brown one."  However, common or garden English dun (dingy brown, dark-colored) and the diminutive ock would also produce dunnock. Cf. pillock.

Description

A European robin-sized bird, the dunnock typically measures 13.5–14 cm in length. It possesses a streaked back, somewhat resembling a small house sparrow. Like that species, the dunnock has a drab appearance in order to avoid predation. It is brownish underneath, and has a fine pointed bill. Adults have a grey head, and both sexes are similarly coloured.

Distribution and habitat

Dunnocks reside in the more mild western and southern parts of the globe, inhabiting much of Europe including Lebanon, northern Iran, and the Caucasus. Dunnocks were successfully introduced into New Zealand during the 19th century, and are now widely distributed around the country and some offshore islands.   Favourite habitats include woodlands, shrubs, gardens, and hedgerows.

Territoriality

 

The main call of the dunnock is a shrill, persistent tseep along with a high trilling note, which betrays the bird's otherwise inconspicuous presence. The song is rapid, thin and tinkling, a sweet warble which can be confused with that of the Eurasian wren, but is shorter and weaker.

Dunnocks are territorial and may engage in conflict with other birds that encroach upon their nests. Males sometimes share a territory and exhibit a strict dominance hierarchy. Nevertheless, this social dominance is not translated into benefits to the alpha male in terms of reproduction, since parternity is usually equally shared between males of the group.   Furthermore, members of a group are rarely related, and so competition can result. 

Female territorial ranges are almost always exclusive. However, sometimes, multiple males will cooperate to defend a single territory containing multiple females. Males exhibit a strong dominance hierarchy within groups: older birds tend to be the alpha males and first-year birds are usually the betas. Studies have found that close male relatives almost never share a territory.

The male’s ability to access females generally depends on female range size, which is affected by the distribution of food. When resources are distributed in dense patches, female ranges tend to be small and easy for males to monopolize. Subsequent mating systems, as discussed below, reflect high reproductive success for males and relatively lower success for females. In times of scarcity, female territories expand to accommodate the lack of resources, causing males to have a more difficult time monopolizing females. Hence, females gain a reproductive advantage over males in this case. 

Breeding

Mating systems

The dunnock possesses variable mating systems. Females are often polyandrous, breeding with two or more males at once,   which is quite rare among birds. This multiple mating system leads to the development of sperm competition amongst the male suitors. DNA fingerprinting has shown that chicks within a brood often have different fathers, depending on the success of the males at monopolising the female.  Males try to ensure their paternity by pecking at the cloaca of the female to stimulate ejection of rival males' sperm.  Dunnocks take just one-tenth of a second to copulate and can mate more than 100 times a day.  Males provide parental care in proportion to their mating success, so two males and a female can commonly be seen provisioning nestlings at one nest.

Other mating systems also exist within dunnock populations, depending on the ratio of male to females and the overlap of territories. When only one female and one male territory overlap, monogamy is preferred. Sometimes, two or three adjacent female territories overlap one male territory, and so polygyny is favored, with the male monopolising several females.  Polygynandry also exists, in which two males jointly defend a territory containing several females.  Polyandry, though, is the most common mating system of dunnocks found in nature.  Depending on the population, males generally have the best reproductive success in polygynous populations, while females have the advantage during polyandry.

Studies have illustrated the fluidity of dunnock mating systems. When given food in abundance, female territory size is reduced drastically. Consequently, males can more easily monopolise the females. Thus, the mating system can be shifted from one that favours female success (polyandry), to one that promotes male success (monogamy, polygynandry, or polygyny). 

Nest

The dunnock builds a neat nest (predominantly from twigs and moss and lined with soft materials such as wool or feathers), low in a bush or conifer, where adults typically lay three to five unspotted blue eggs.

Parental care and provisioning

Broods, depending on the population, can be raised by a lone female, multiple females with the part-time help of a male, multiple females with full-time help by a male, or by multiple females and multiple males. In pairs, the male and the female invest parental care at similar rates. However, in trios, the female and alpha male invest more care in chicks than does the beta male. In territories in which females are able to escape from males, both the alpha and beta males share provisioning equally. This last system represents the best case scenario for females, as it helps to ensure maximal care and the success of the young.

A study has found that males tend to not discriminate between their own young and those of another male in polyandrous or polygynandrous systems. However, they do vary their feeding depending on the certainty of paternity. If a male has greater access to a female, and therefore a higher chance of a successful fertilisation, during a specific mating period, it would provide more care towards the young.
Question:
What is the 'Dunnock' more commonly known as?
Answer:
Hedge accentor
Passage:
President of the Confederate States of America
The President of the Confederate States of America was the elected head of state and government of the Confederate States. The president also headed the executive branch of government and was commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy, and of the militia of the several states when called into Confederate service. 

Article II of the Confederate States Constitution vested the executive power of the Confederacy in the president. The power included the execution of law, alongside the responsibility of appointing executive, diplomatic, regulatory and judicial officers, and concluding treaties with foreign powers with the advice and consent of the senate. He was further empowered to grant reprieves and pardons, and convene and adjourn either or both houses of congress under extraordinary circumstances.

The president was indirectly elected by the people through the Electoral College to a six-year term, and was one of only two nationally elected Confederate officers, the other being the Vice President of the Confederate States. On February 18, 1861, Jefferson Davis became president of the provisional government. On February 22, 1862, he was elected president of the permanent government and served in that capacity until being captured by elements of the United States Cavalry in 1865. 

Powers and duties

The constitutional powers of the President of the Confederate States of America were quite similar to those of the President of the United States of America. The permanent Confederate States Constitution made him commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy, and of the militia of the several states when called into service of the Confederate States. He was also empowered to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the Confederate States. He was authorized to make treaties; to nominate and appoint diplomatic representatives, judges, and other officers of the Confederate States (including the heads of the executive departments) by and with the consent of the Confederate States Senate; and to remove such representatives and officers. He could fill vacancies during a recess of the Senate, but he could not reappoint, during a recess, persons previously rejected by it. He was to supply Congress with information, recommend legislation, receive ambassadors and other public ministers, see that the federal laws were faithfully executed, and commission all officers of the military and naval forces of the Confederate States.

Election and oath

On February 9, 1861, the provisional congress at Montgomery elected Jefferson Davis president and Alexander H. Stephens vice president. Stephens, who was a delegate to Congress from Georgia, was inaugurated on February 11. Davis was inaugurated on February 18 upon his arrival from Mississippi, where he had gone upon his resignation from the U.S. Senate. Davis and Stephens were elected on November 6, 1861, for six-years terms, as provided by the permanent constitution. The Capital had been moved in June 1861, to Richmond, and the inauguration took place at the statue of Washington, on the public square, on February 22, 1862.

Before Davis entered on the execution of his office as President of the Confederate States, he was constitutionally required to take the following oath or affirmation:

Compensation

In 1861, the President of the Confederate States earned a $25,000 annual salary, along with an expense account, and a nontaxable travel account.  The President's Office was located on the second floor of the Custom House on Main Street, a structure which also housed the Cabinet Room and the State and Treasury Department. The City of Richmond purchased the Brockenbrough house for presentation to the Confederate government for use as an executive mansion. Davis declined to accept the gift, but the mansion was leased for his use. Referred to as the "White House of the Confederacy" or the "Grey House," the mansion was used by President Davis throughout the existence of his presidency. Later it became a repository for documents, relics, and pictures, and in 1896 it was redesignated the Confederate Museum.

Post-presidency

Late on the evening of April 2, 1865, President Davis, his aides, and members of the Cabinet, except Secretary of War Breckinridge, departed from Richmond on the Richmond and Danville Railroad. The Cabinet stayed at Danville, 140 mi miles southwest of Richmond, until April 10, when, hearing of Lee's surrender, it continued farther south. At Greensboro, North Carolina, on April 12 the Cabinet met with Generals Johnston and Beauregard and discussed surrender of Johnston's army to General Sherman. As the railroad south of Greensboro had been destroyed, the flight from that location was on horseback and in ambulances, wagons, and carriages. The last Cabinet meetings took place at Charlotte, on April 24, and 26, and on May 4; when Davis left Washington, Georgia, the party consisted only of his aides and Postmaster General Reagan. Elements of the United States Cavalry captured Davis and his companions at an encampment near Irwinville, May 10, 1865.

Jefferson Davis was imprisoned at Fort Monroe, Virginia, until his release on bail on May 13, 1867. During his confinement the United States Government prepared to bring him to trial for treason and for complicity in the assassination of United States President Abraham Lincoln. He could not be tried in Virginia until the Federal court was reestablished there, but by the time the circuit judges were prepared in May 1867 the United States Government decided the outcome of a trial before a local jury was far too uncertain and dropped the proceedings. In November 1868 Davis was brought to trial under a new indictment, but the judges disagreed and the case was referred to the Supreme Court. President Johnson issued a general amnesty in December 1868, and the Supreme Court entered a nolle prosequi, thus freeing Davis.

Image caption Rebecca Adlington (l) won Team GB's second medal on Sunday, while some events still had empty seats and others were disrupted by rain
Team GB has won its first London 2012 medals, with cyclist Lizzie Armitstead taking silver in the women's road race.
Swimmer Rebecca Adlington has taken bronze in the final of the 400m freestyle.
London 2012 chairman Lord Coe insisted Olympics venues were "stuffed" with sports fans, after a row about empty seats on Saturday.
However, on Sunday empty seats could be seen at several sports, including basketball, volleyball and tennis.
Armitstead, 23, from Otley near Leeds, was beaten to the gold at the end of the 140-kilometre race by Holland's Marianne Vos in a sprint finish on The Mall.
She said: "I'm really, really happy. Maybe later I'll start thinking about that gold, but I'm happy with silver at the moment."
Adlington, 23, who lost her title to Camille Muffat of France, said she was glad she had won a medal at a home games.
"The crowd were just absolutely amazing, this is what I wanted, this is what picks you up, this is what gets you from fourth to third and gets us on that podium. I know so many people wanted me to get the gold and sorry about that, but I tried my absolute hardest, I'm so pleased with that."
She later tweeted: : "Ahhhhhhhh bronze medal!!! Can't believe it! SOOO happy its unreal! The crowd was incredible! THANK YOU to everyone, your support is amazing!"
Adlington's battle to hold on to her 800m freestyle title will begin with heats on Thursday morning before Friday night's final.
In other Olympic developments:
Police say 16 people have been arrested over ticket touting at the Olympics during the past two days
Three people have been charged after 182 were held following a Critical Mass cycle ride near the Olympic Park on Friday
Lord Coe spoke out as the row mounted over unfilled seats in several Olympic venues.
At some venues, seats in the accredited "Olympic family" areas - reserved for groups including officials, sports federations, athletes, journalists and sponsors - have remained empty.
Media captionSebastian Coe: "I'm not sure that naming shaming is what we are into"
"I don't think you will be seeing this as an issue, long-term through the Games," he told a press conference.
Organisers Locog said it would fill some of the empty seats with servicemen and women, as well as local students and teachers.
It said it would also sell more tickets, after some 1,000 tickets were released on the London 2012 website on Saturday night.
A system has been introduced similar to the one used at Wimbledon, where people coming out of the stadium handed on their tickets so the seats could be made available to others.
A Locog spokesman added that it would examine options to upgrade the tickets of members of the public and move them into accredited areas.
Olympics coverage online
On Sunday, empty seats were seen at venues including basketball at the Olympic Park, where troops filled the gaps, tennis at Wimbledon and volleyball at Earl's Court.
Around 100 seats at the gymnastics at the North Greenwich Arena were also given to troops.
But many other venues were full, including boxing, judo and fencing at ExCel, badminton at Wembley Arena and shooting at the Royal Artillery Barracks.
American Paul Fondie, who now lives in Kew, west London, said he was frustrated by the number of empty seats at the men's gymnastics at the O2 on Saturday.
Image caption Lizzie Armitstead (r) won silver in the women's road race
He said he and his wife had not been able to take their six-year-old son because they could not get an extra ticket.
"It tainted my experience of the Olympics - it was our moment to come under the microscope and show that London can do it well."
Andy Murray has claimed his first Olympic singles victory, beating Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka 6-3 6-3.
And Briton Ben Ainslie opened his quest for a fourth Olympic gold medal with a second place finish in the opening race in the sailing at Weymouth Bay.
British teams have been competing in basketball, handball, hockey, volleyball, water polo and the football on Sunday.

For most of the first half of the 20th century, Venezuela was ruled by generally        benevolent military strongmen, who promoted the oil industry and allowed for some        social reforms. Democratically elected governments have held sway since 1959.
Under Hugo CHAVEZ, president from 1999 to 2013, and his hand-picked successor, President Nicolas MADURO, the executive branch has exercised increasingly authoritarian control over other branches of government. At the same time, democratic institutions have deteriorated, threats to freedom of expression have increased, and political polarization has grown.
Current concerns include: an increasingly politicized military, rampant violent crime, high inflation, and widespread shortages of basic consumer goods, medicine, and medical supplies, overdependence on the petroleum industry with its price        fluctuations, and irresponsible mining operations that are endangering the rain        forest and indigenous peoples.
Venezuela assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2015-16 term.

Passage:
Vesti la giubba
"" ("Put on the costume", sometimes translated as "On With the Motley") is a famous tenor aria from Ruggero Leoncavallo's 1892 opera Pagliacci. "" is sung at the conclusion of the first act, when Canio discovers his wife's infidelity, but must nevertheless prepare for his performance as Pagliaccio the clown because "the show must go on".

The aria is often regarded as one of the most moving in the operatic repertoire of the time. The pain of Canio is portrayed in the aria and exemplifies the entire notion of the "tragic clown": smiling on the outside but crying on the inside. This is still displayed today, as the clown motif often features the painted-on tear running down the cheek of the performer.

Enrico Caruso's recordings of the aria, from 1902, 1904 and 1909, were among the top selling records of the 78-rpm era..The New Guinness Book of Records, ed. Peter Matthews, Guinness Publishing. 1995. p.150 

This aria is often used in popular culture, and has been featured in many renditions, mentions, and spoofs.

Passage:
Battle of Bomarsund
The Battle of Bomarsund was fought by an Anglo-French task force against Russian defenses at Bomarsund during the Crimean War.

Background 

Bomarsund was a 19th-century fortress, the construction of which had started in 1832 by Russia in Sund, Åland Islands, in the Baltic Sea. Bomarsund had not been completed (only two towers of the planned twelve subsidiary towers had been completed). When the war broke out the fortress remained vulnerable especially against forces attacking over land. Designers of the fortress had also assumed that narrow sea passages near the fortress would not be passable for large naval ships; while this assumption had held true during the time of sailing ships, it was possible for steam powered ships to reach weakly defended sections of the fortress.

First battle 

On 21 June 1854, three British ships bombarded the Bomarsund fortress. Artillery from the shore, however, responded and, while both sides suffered some damage, the casualties were light. The first battle was indecisive. During the battle, Charles Davis Lucas tossed overboard a shell which had landed on board. The shell exploded before it reached water. For saving his ship he was the first man to be awarded the Victoria Cross. 

Second battle 

While the first battle had been a brief clash and artillery duel, the second battle was a different affair. By the end of July 1854, a British fleet of 25 ships had surrounded the fortress and only waited for the French ground troops to arrive. Both defender and attacker had acknowledged that the fort could not be defeated by naval forces alone and made preparations accordingly, Russian forces destroyed the surrounding countryside in an effort to force British and French forces break away from the assumed siege.

Landing on 8 August, the British troops established a battery of three 32-pounder guns on a hill, the French establishing several batteries. 
On 13 August 1854, the French artillery opened fire on a tower and by the end of the day were in a position that while artillery suppressed the defenders of subsidiary tower of Brännklint, French infantry assaulted it.  Defenders found their position to be hopeless and withdrew the bulk of their forces to the main fort leaving only small detachment behind to supervise demolition of the tower. While French troops managed to capture the tower before it was demolished, it did not save the tower since the Russian artillery now opened fire at the captured tower and on 15 August 1854 scored a hit to the gunpowder magazines. The resulting explosion demolished the tower.

The second tower, Notvik, was also lost on 15 August 1854 after British guns opened fire from their hill opposite to the tower. After eight hours of bombardment they managed to create a gaping hole to the fort. After most of the guns had been lost commandant of the tower surrendered to the British and French forces.

The bombardment of the main fortress started late on 15 August 1854 with land based guns and the navy opening fire. With only a few guns capable of firing in the direction of the bombarding ships, the Russian forces hoped for the French and British forces to attack over land. However, after the bombardment continued into the 16 August without any indication of landings, it became apparent to the Russian commander that British and French intended to reduce the fortress with artillery fire. As the situation appeared hopeless, Bomarsund surrendered on 16 August 1854.

The early surrender came as a surprise of the French and British. 2,000 men laid down their arms and became prisoners.

Aftermath 

After the surrender, French and British forces demolished the fortress. British engineers remained until mid-September to ensure it could not be easily rebuilt.

Three hundred Finnish grenadiers defending the fortress were captured and imprisoned in Lewes in the United Kingdom.  They were later allowed to return to Finland, and they returned with a song telling about their battles and imprisonment, called the War of Åland ("Finnish: Oolannin sota, Swedish: "Det Åländska kriget). The Russian Memorial was erected in Lewes in 1877 to honour those who died in captivity.

In the Treaty of Paris 1856, the entire Åland Islands were demilitarized, which is a status that has been preserved until this day.

The Bomarsund Bridge connects Bomarsund to the Prästö island.

Victoria Cross recipients 

In addition to Charles Davis Lucas several other Victoria Crosses were awarded in the Baltic Theater during the Crimean War.
