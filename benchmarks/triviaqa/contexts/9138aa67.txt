My Camera Never Lies
"My Camera Never Lies" is a 1982 single by pop group Bucks Fizz. It became the group's second consecutive (and third overall) UK number-one in April 1982.  The song was written by Andy Hill and Nichola Martin, and was featured on Bucks Fizz's second album Are You Ready.

Overview

Background

"My Camera Never Lies" was written by Andy Hill and Nichola Martin and produced by Andy Hill. Hill was the group's regular songwriter and producer, while Martin had been the woman who had put the group together and occasionally co-wrote some songs. This was her only No. 1 hit, although she also co-penned the follow-up, "Now Those Days Are Gone", which was a top 10 hit. Hill recorded the male vocals first since they were more straightforward and then added in the female parts. He considered the middle section with the members repeating "my camera" at each other to be the most complex part, but commended the group for mastering this sequence without prior rehearsal. The lyrics concern a man who is following his partner around to investigate her actions. The "camera" of the title being his view of the situation. 

The promotional video which accompanied the song  begins with shots of the group in a white room dressed in new romantic-style clothes. The group members are seen singing the song to camera (sometimes through an Olympus 35mm lens) in a blue-tinged studio. The chorus sees them performing the song's dance routine to camera while intercut with split-screen effects of all four members. Interspersed through the video are quick snippets of the group re-enacting scenes from famous movies including Bonnie and Clyde, Gone With the Wind, The Wizard of Oz and Cleopatra.  Member Cheryl Baker was dressed as Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz clip but has since confirmed that the other characters depicted were not Bucks Fizz but production personnel.

Release and reception

"My Camera Never Lies" was released on 12 March 1982 and entered the UK Singles chart at No. 35. The following week it rose dramatically to No. 5. Two weeks later it became the third UK number one single for Bucks Fizz for a single week in April 1982, and saw the group reach the peak of their career, being the follow-up to "The Land of Make Believe", which had also reached No. 1 a few months earlier. The single was one of the group's biggest hits and after a swift fall from the top, remained on the chart for eight weeks. This was to be the group's final No. 1, but gave Bucks Fizz their third chart topper in 12 months. It was one of the top 40 selling singles of the year. It peaked at No. 2 in Ireland but fared less well in other countries.

With this song, Bucks Fizz found themselves in favour with the music press who were normally damning of 'middle-of-the-road' pop. The song is considered by the group's fans to be among their best, while member Mike Nolan considers it one of their most mature singles but perhaps was released too early in their career. The single received a positive review in NME saying "[it] is a complex, almost excessive record that transcends the sphere of commercial mush into which it is born" comparing it to Heatwave, ABBA and contemporaries Dollar saying that "its almost too good to succeed".  In 2015, Guardian journalist Bob Stanley commented favourably on the song calling it their "key record" albeit "relatively forgotten [for a number one single]". He goes on to say "ushered in on aerated harmonies, it cuts to a hard, shiny acoustic guitar riff and a lyric that could be about the narcissistic dullness of having 'made it', or the paranoia of surveillance, followed by a 'camera-ra-ra-ra' wherever you go".[http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jul/01/bucks-fizz-abba-bob-stanley-eurovision The Guardian, Bob Stanley. "Bucks Fizz: more than just a Kwik Save Abba"] 1 July 2015 The same publication's reviewer Tom Ewing said that "My Camera Never Lies" was "trying to cram all of new wave and new pop into a single super-compressed hybrid, halfway between Devo and Dollar". Stanley also goes on to mention the single's B-side "What Am I Gonna Do" commenting on it switching from pop to rock between verse and chorus saying; "Does it hang together? Incredibly, it does".

"My Camera Never Lies" featured on the group's second album, Are You Ready, released two months later. It featured a slightly longer version which extends the ending with overlaid drum sounds which then blend into the next track "Easy Love". Another extended version of the song was released on 12" single. A slight reworking with some re-recorded vocals was released on The Lost Masters album in 2006. In 2012 The Original Bucks Fizz re-recorded the song on their album Fame and Fortune? in a completely reworked slow-tempo style.

Passage:
Juan María Bordaberry
Juan María Bordaberry Arocena (17 June 1928 – 17 July 2011 ) was a Uruguayan dictator, politician and cattle rancher, who first served as a constitutional President from 1972 until 1973, and then ruled as the head of a civilian-military dictatorship up to 1976.

He came to office following the Presidential elections of late 1971.  In 1973, Bordaberry dissolved the General Assembly and was widely regarded as ruling by decree as a military-sponsored dictator until disagreements with the military led to his being overthrown before his original term of office had expired. On November 17, 2006 he was arrested in a case involving four deaths, including two of members of the General Assembly during the period of civilian-military rule in the 1970s.

Background and earlier career

Bordaberry was born in 1928 in Montevideo, Uruguay's capital. Juan María Bordaberry's father was Domingo Bordaberry, who served in the Senate and in Ruralist leadership, and he was the heir to one of the largest ranches in the country. Initially, Juan María Bordaberry belonged to the National Party, popularly known as the , and was elected to the Senate on the Blanco ticket. In 1964, however, he assumed the leadership  of Liga Nacional de Accion Ruralista (Spanish for "National Rural Action League"), and in 1969 joined the Colorado Party.

Agriculture Minister

That year he was appointed to the Cabinet, where he sat from 1969 to 1971 as agriculture minister in the government of President Jorge Pacheco, having had a long association with rural affairs (see Domingo Bordaberry).

President of Uruguay

Bordaberry was elected president as the Colorado candidate in 1971.  He took office in 1972 in the midst of an institutional crisis caused by the authoritarian rule of Pacheco and the terrorist threat. Bordaberry, at the time, had been a minor political figure; he exercised little independent standing as a successor to Pacheco other than being Pacheco's handpicked successor. He continued Pacheco's authoritarian methods, suspending civil liberties, banning labor unions, and imprisoning and killing opposition figures. He appointed military officers to most leading government positions. 

Before and after his period of Presidential office, he was identified with schemes for agricultural improvement; his Agriculture minister was Benito Medero. In personal terms, one of Bordaberry's actions which proved in hindsight to have been disadvantageous was his appointment of Jorge Sapelli as Vice President of Uruguay, given the latter's resignation and public repudiation of him in 1973.  On June 27, 1973; Bordaberry dissolved Congress, suspended the Constitution and gave the military and police the power to take whatever measures it deemed necessary to restore order. For the next three years, he ruled by decree with the assistance of a National Security Council ("COSENA").

There were several important public figures in his cabinet. During the first, democratic years, Julio María Sanguinetti, José Antonio Mora, Luis Barrios Tassano, Pablo Purriel; later, during the dictatorial period, Alejandro Végh Villegas, Juan Carlos Blanco Estradé, Walter Ravenna, Néstor Bolentini.

Ouster by military

In 1976, Bordaberry proposed to abolish the parties and set up a corporatist state according to a pattern with little precedent in Uruguayan history.  The military refused to go along and forced Bordaberry to resign.  Bordaberry then returned to his ranch.

Family

One of Juan María's sons, Pedro Bordaberry, Minister for Tourism and Industry in the government of Jorge Batlle. Another son, Santiago, is a rural affairs activist. 

Arrest

On 17 November 2006, following an order by judge Roberto Timbal, Bordaberry was placed under arrest along with his former foreign minister Juan Carlos Blanco Estradé. He was arrested in connection with the 1976 assassination of two legislators, Senator Zelmar Michelini of the Christian Democratic Party and House leader Héctor Gutiérrez of the National Party. The assassinations took place in Buenos Aires but the prosecution argued they had been part of Operation Condor, in which the military regimes of Uruguay and Argentina coordinated actions against dissidents. Timbal ruled that since the killings took place outside Uruguay, they were not covered by an amnesty enacted after the return of civilian rule in 1985. 

On 23 January 2007, he was hospitalized in Montevideo with serious respiratory problems. Because of his health problems the judge Paublo Eguern ordered that Bordaberry be transferred to house arrest. From 27 January he served his prison term in the house of one of his sons in Montevideo. On 1 June 2007, an Appellate Court confirmed the continuation of the case of the murders of Michelini and Gutiérrez Ruiz. On 10 September 2007, another Appellate Court opened a new case to be tried by Judge Gatti for 10 homicides, for violations of the constitution. 

On 7 February 2008, the BPS, Social Security Administration, suspended Bordaberry's retirement payments as ex-president of the country.

Opposition and support

Bordaberry's arrest was generally met with satisfaction and regarded as the end of impunity in Uruguay, a country considered by some to have lagged behind other Latin American nations in this matter.  However, former President Julio Sanguinetti has been critical of the one-sided prosecution of individuals involved in the conflict, and there has been lively media debate regarding issues surrounding Bordaberry's arrest.

One of his sons, Pedro Bordaberry, himself presidential candidate and a former minister, has been vocal in public support for his father, and, by strong implication, for a measure of justification for the role of the civilian-military government of 1973–1985. Another son, Santiago Bordaberry, is a rancher and religious activist and has been prominent in the former President's public defence.

Conviction

On 5 March 2010, Bordaberry was sentenced to 30 years in prison (the maximum allowed under Uruguayan law) for murder, becoming the second former Uruguayan dictator sentenced to a long prison term; in October 2009, Gregorio Conrado Álvarez was sentenced to 25 years. He had also been unsuccessfully tried for violating the constitution in the 1973 coup.

Death

On 17 July 2011, Bordaberry died, aged 83, at his home. He had been suffering from respiratory problems and other illnesses.   His remains are buried at Parque Martinelli de Carrasco.

Passage:
Bettys and Taylors of Harrogate
Bettys and Taylors of Harrogate, also known as Bettys and Taylors Group Limited,  is a family company based in Yorkshire, England. The company's brands are Bettys (with no apostrophe), Taylors of Harrogate and Yorkshire Tea.  Bettys Café Tea Rooms are traditional tea rooms serving traditional meals with influences both from Switzerland and Yorkshire. Taylors of Harrogate was a family tea and coffee merchant company, founded in 1886, which blended Yorkshire Tea and Taylors of Harrogate Coffee; the owners of Bettys acquired Taylors in 1962. Bettys products are handmade and use high quality ingredients, usually sourced locally. The current chairman of the company is Lesley Wild, solicitor, designer, author and wife of Jonathan Wild, the great-nephew of the founder Frederick Belmont.  
Yorkshire Tea was introduced by Charles Edward Taylor and his brother in 1883, creating their company, CE Taylor & Co., which was later shortened to "Taylor's". The brothers later opened "Tea Kiosks" in the Yorkshire towns of Harrogate and Ilkley, and in 1962, local tea room competitor 'Betty's' took over 'Taylor's', renamed it 'Taylors of Harrogate' and formed Bettys and Taylors Group, which still to this day, is owned by the family of Fredrick Belmont, who founded 'Betty's Tea Rooms'. The Group now uses the 'Bettys' and 'Taylors' brands in a number of industries including Yorkshire Tea and Taylors Coffee Merchants under the 'Taylors of Harrogate' name and Bettys Tea Rooms, Bettys Cookery School and Bettys Confectionery under the 'Bettys' brand.
 

History 

The first Bettys tea room was opened on Cambridge Crescent in Harrogate, West Riding of Yorkshire, by Frederick Belmont, a Swiss confectioner, in July 1919.  The Harrogate tea rooms later moved to their current position on Parliament Street.

Belmont arrived in England at King's Cross railway station able to speak little English and losing his document with the address of his destination. After approaching many passers by, an old gentleman who spoke a small amount of French managed to tell him where he was going, Bradford. Belmont returned to King's Cross shouting "Bradfat" at any railway station official he could find; eventually he managed to board the correct train to Bradford. In the 1920s, Belmont opened a craft bakery in Harrogate, which meant it was possible to open more tea rooms, including a York branch.

The origin of the Bettys name is unknown.  The company's website suggests four possibilities: Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, mother of Queen Elizabeth II (which seems unlikely as she did not come to public prominence until marrying the Duke of York in 1923); Betty Lupton, former manager of the Harrogate Spa; the daughter of a previous occupant of the Harrogate premises who died of tuberculosis; or a small child who interrupted a meeting at which the choice of name was being discussed.

The merger with Taylors of Harrogate (founded 1886) came about in 1962.

In 2001 Bettys opened a cookery school on the same site as their craft bakery, at Plumpton Park near Harrogate. 

Bettys marked their 90th anniversary in July 2009 with afternoon tea of patisseries, fancies and cakes from the past served by waitresses dressed in period costumes. 

 

Tea rooms 

There are currently six Bettys tea rooms, which all comprise a shop as well as a café. The locations of the tea rooms are:

*Bettys Harrogate - Parliament Street, Harrogate
*Bettys York - St Helen's Square, York
*Bettys Stonegate (formerly Little Bettys) - Stonegate, York
*Bettys Northallerton - High Street, Northallerton
*Bettys Ilkley - The Grove, Ilkley
*Bettys Harlow Carr - RHS Harlow Carr, Harrogate

The St Helen's Square café in York was inspired by the magnificent RMS Queen Mary cruise liner and became particularly popular during World War II when the basement ‘Bettys Bar’ became a favourite with hundreds of American and Canadian ‘Bomber Boys’ who were stationed around York. ‘Bettys Mirror’, on which many of them engraved their signatures with a diamond pen, remains on display at the branch today.

In 1962 Bettys joined forces with another Yorkshire business, family tea and coffee merchants, Taylors of Harrogate, who still manufacture Yorkshire Tea and Taylors of Harrogate Coffee.

Until 1976 there was a Bettys tea room in Commercial Street, Leeds in premises now (as at February 2008) used as a mobile phone shop. There was also a tea room in Bradford, on Darley Street. 

Bettys have refused many times to open a branch outside Yorkshire, claiming that keeping Bettys small means a watchful eye can be kept on every detail.
