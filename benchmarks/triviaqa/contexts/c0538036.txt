Passage:
Narrative poetry
Narrative poetry is a form of poetry that tells a story, often making use of the voices of a narrator and characters as well; the entire story is usually written in metered verse. Narrative poems do not have to follow rhythmic patterns. The poems that make up this genre may be short or long, and the story it relates to may be complex. It is normally dramatic, with objectives, diverse characters, and metre.  Narrative poems include epics, ballads, idylls, and lays.

Some narrative poetry takes the form of a novel in verse. An example of this is The Ring and the Book by Robert Browning. In terms of narrative poetry, a romance is a narrative poem that tells a story of chivalry. Examples include the Romance of the Rose or Tennyson's  Idylls of the King. Although these examples use medieval and Arthurian materials, romances may also tell stories from classical mythology. 

Shorter narrative poems are often similar in style to the short story. Sometimes these short narratives are collected into interrelated groups, as with Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales. Some literatures contain prose narratives, and the Old Norse sagas include both incidental poetry and the biographies of poets. An example is "The Cremation of Sam McGee" by Robert Service.

Oral tradition

The oral tradition predates essentially all other modern forms of communication. For thousands of years, people groups accurately passed on their history through the Oral Tradition from generation to generation. As a clear example and the oldest one comes from Ancient India, the Vedic Chant, which is often considered the oldest unbroken oral tradition in existence today. In addition, one of the most notable was the ancient Hebrews, people of the Middle East; they were taught and passed on the stories of God. Surprisingly this tradition lives on even today through such efforts as SimplyTheStory.org, for example, that trains indigenous story tellers in over 115 countries worldwide. The poetry in the Bible is called the Psalms, that capture stories of conquest, failure, confession and more. Some of it is narrative in nature.

Historically, much of poetry has its source in an oral tradition: in more recent times the Scots and English ballads, the tales of Robin Hood, of Iskandar, and various Baltic and Slavic heroic poems all were originally intended for recitation, rather than reading. In many cultures, there remains a lively tradition of the recitation of traditional tales in verse formativeness. It has been suggested that some of the distinctive features that distinguish poetry from prose, such as metre, alliteration and kennings, at one time served as memory aids that allowed the bards who recited traditional tales to reconstruct them from memory. 

A narrative poem usually tells a story using a poetic theme. Epic poems are very vital to narrative poems, although it is thought that narrative poems were created to explain oral traditions. The focus of narrative poetry is often the pros and cons of life.

Passage:
An Essay on Criticism
An Essay on Criticism is one of the first major poems written by the English writer Alexander Pope (1688–1744). It is written in a type of rhyming verse called heroic couplets.
"A little knowlegde is a dangerous thing" is an oft-quoted line of Alexander Pope. The poem first appeared in 1711.   It was written in 1709, and it is clear from Pope's correspondence  that many of the poem's ideas had existed in prose form since at least 1706. It is a verse essay written in the Horatian mode and is primarily concerned with how writers and critics behave in the new literary commerce of Pope's contemporary age. The poem covers a range of good criticism and advice, and represents many of the chief literary ideals of Pope's age.

Pope contends in the poem's opening couplets that bad criticism does greater harm than bad writing: 

'Tis hard to say, if greater Want of Skill
Appear in Writing or in Judging ill,
But, of the two, less dang'rous is th' Offence,
To tire our Patience, than mis-lead our Sense
Some few in that, but Numbers err in this,
Ten Censure wrong for one who Writes amiss;
A Fool might once himself alone expose,
Now One in Verse makes many more in Prose. ... (1–8)

Despite the harmful effects of bad criticism, literature requires worthy criticism. 

Pope delineates common faults of poets, e.g., settling for easy and cliché rhymes:

And ten low words oft creep in one dull line:
While they ring round the same unvaried chimes,
With sure returns of still expected rhymes;
Wher'er you find "the cooling western breeze",
In the next line, it "whispers through the trees";
If crystal streams "with pleasing murmurs creep",
The reader's threatened (not in vain) with "sleep" . . . (347–353)
               
Throughout the poem, Pope refers to ancient writers such as Virgil, Homer, Aristotle, Horace and Longinus. This is a testament to his belief that the "Imitation of the ancients" is the ultimate standard for taste. Pope also says, "True ease in writing comes from art, not chance, / As those move easiest who have learned to dance" (362–363), meaning poets are made, not born.

As is usual in Pope's poems, the Essay concludes with a reference to Pope himself. Walsh, the last of the critics mentioned, was a mentor and friend of Pope who had died in 1710.

An Essay on Criticism was famously and fiercely attacked by John Dennis, who is mentioned mockingly in the work. Consequently, Dennis also appears in Pope's later satire, The Dunciad.

Part II of An Essay on Criticism includes a famous couplet:

A little learning is a dangerous thing;
Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring.

This is in reference to the spring in the Pierian Mountains in Macedonia, sacred to the Muses. The first line of this couplet is often misquoted as "a little knowledge is a dangerous thing".

The Essay also gives this famous line (towards the end of Part II):

To err is human, to forgive divine.

The phrase "fools rush in where angels fear to tread" from Part III has become part of the popular lexicon, and has been used for and in various works.

Passage:
Harry Hole
Harry Hole is the main character in a series of crime novels written by Norwegian author Jo Nesbø. Hole is a brilliant and driven detective with unorthodox methods, a classic loose cannon in the police force.

Character

Harry Hole, a police officer with the Oslo Crime Squad, lost his mother, a descendant of the Sami people, to cancer while he was in his twenties, and he has never had a close relationship to his father, Olav Hole, a former teacher. He was born in 1965, and has a younger sister with Down syndrome. He is unmarried, but has had close relationships with a number of women throughout the series of ten novels. Otherwise, he has few close friends – and the ability to make enemies from amongst his colleagues who, nevertheless, grudgingly respect him.

Hole is a heavy smoker and an alcoholic although, at times, his alcoholism is under control. The effects of his problem sometimes bring him into repeated conflict with his superiors and some colleagues, but Bjarne Møller, head of Hole's department and one of his closest friends, manages to prevent him from being sacked as a result, primarily because he recognises that Harry Hole is a brilliant detective who is recognised amongst his colleagues because of his role in the solving the case of a serial killer in Australia. Hole is one of few in the force who has undergone special training in police interrogation techniques and firearms by the FBI.

Hole has few friends within the Oslo Police Department, exceptions being some staff at the forensics division of the Norwegian police, including Beate Lønn, whom he often uses to secure crucial information in critical situations where specialist knowledge is required, and Bjørn Holm, another skilled forensics officer. Harry is also friendly with Gunnar Hagen, his former senior officer prior to the case chronicled in Phantom.

In many ways, the author's home city of Oslo has the starring role in the Harry Hole novels. Much of the background detail of the stories involves real locations, and the city is shown "warts and all", ranging from Hole's favourite eating and drinking places that he frequents, to the traffic of the so-called "Traffic Machine" road system, the real-life headquarters of the Police Department, the swimming pool at Frogner Park, to the haunts of neo-Nazis, drug addicts and prostitutes, all of this described vividly (in the various novels) at different times of the year – in the snow and freezing weather of winter to the high temperatures of a particularly warm summer. Harry Hole's friends and acquaintances include city residents from every social background, including immigrants from other parts of the world to old school friends such as Øystein Eikeland, the taxi driver – possibly the person with whom he is closest.

Harry Hole's home address is in Sofies Gate in Bislett, Oslo. In Phantom he no longer lives here, as he has been in Hong Kong for three years. Near his place of residence is his favourite "watering hole", Restaurant Schrøder (Schrøder's, for short) in St. Hanshaugen, which figures in most of the novels. He has had a serious relationship with Rakel Fauke, whose son, Oleg, looks up to Harry as a father figure. After the case chronicled in The Snowman, their relationship is put under severe pressure.

"Hole", Harry's family name, is the name of a historic Norwegian town (Hole, Norway), with a heritage that goes back to Norway's origins in the Viking Age. The name is derived from Old Norse Hólar, the plural form of hóll, meaning "round (and isolated) hill". The word is pronounced as two syllables, with stress on the first (hoh-leh), as is implied in The Bat, where the Australian police call him "Harry Holy".

Appearances in the Harry Hole series

* In The Bat (1997), Hole is sent to Sydney, Australia to aid the Australian police in their investigation of the murder of a Norwegian citizen.
* In Cockroaches (1998), Hole is sent to Thailand to investigate the murder of the Norwegian ambassador.
* In The Redbreast (2000), Hole tracks an assassin planning an attack on a prominent member of the establishment.
* In Nemesis (2002), Hole investigates a fatal bank robbery and becomes implicated in the apparent murder of an ex-girlfriend.
* In The Devil's Star (2003), Hole investigates a series of serial killings and suspects a fellow policeman of criminal activity. 
* In The Redeemer (2005), Hole is on the trail of a Croatian hitman who kills a Salvation Army officer during a Christmas street concert.
* In The Snowman (2007), Hole struggles to identify Norway's first serial killer.
* In The Leopard (2009), Hole returns from self-imposed exile in Hong Kong and unofficially investigates a serial killer.
* In Phantom (2011), Hole again returns from Hong Kong to look into a murder apparently committed by his would-be son, Oleg. His investigation draws him into Oslo's drug scene.
* In Police (2013), Hole is needed once again to discover the identity of a serial killer who is stalking the streets of Oslo, killing police officers who previously investigated old cases.

Passage:
Color preferences
In the psychology of color, color preferences are the tendency for an individual or a group to prefer some colors over others, such as having a favorite color.

Introduction

An 'ecological valence theory' (EVT) has been suggested to explain why people have preferences for different colors. This is the idea that the preference for color is determined by the average affective response to everything the individual associates with the color. Hence, positive emotional experiences with a particular color are likely to increase the propensity to develop a preference for that color and vice versa. Social and cultural factors also factor into this affective response. A study in 2011 on the effects of "school spirit" and color preferences found members of Berkeley were more likely to favor the school's official colors than rival university Stanford. This degree of preference was also correlated with their self-reported level of "school spirit". The researchers conducting the study concluded that this was evidence for the EVT. 

Children's color preferences

The age when infants begin showing a preference for color is at about 12 weeks old.  Generally, children prefer the colors red/ pink  and blue, and cool colors are preferred over warm colors.  Purple is the color favored more by girls than by boys.  Color perception of children 3–5 years of age is an indicator of their developmental stage.  Color preferences tend to change as people age. 

Color preferences in different societies

Favoritism of colors varies widely. Often societal influences will have a direct impact on what colors we favor and disdain. In the West, the color black symbolizes mourning and sadness, red symbolizes anger and violence, white symbolizes purity and peace, and yellow symbolizes joy and luck (other colors lack a consistent meaning). From a recent study, it was discussed that associative learning is the process where an individual develops color preferences. In different countries, color preference vary. In China, red indicates luck, while in Nigeria and Germany it means the exact opposite.  An excerpt from Dr. Isaac H. Godlove describes American views on color:
"In recent years, these troublous times have made some of us chronically blue. Our business was in the red. We were going home with a dark brown taste in the mouth. We were unable to look through the old rose-tinted glasses to see the yellow-golden flood again flowing our way. The purple depression had us contemplating black mourning for dying business, departed bank accounts and profits.  But we took a hitch in our belts and carried on, waiting for the rosy dawn, for we lacked the yellow streak. We toned up our product, gave it a more healthy complexion, made it more attractive; put more color spice into our sales appeal."

Passage:
Dirtee Disco
"Dirtee Disco" is the fifth single from British rapper Dizzee Rascal's fourth studio album Tongue n' Cheek, although the song only appears in the deluxe edition of the album. It features background vocals from former One True Voice member Daniel Pearce and samples The Staple Singers' 1972 track, "I'll Take You There". It was released on 23 May 2010 by digital download.

Critical reception

Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song a negative review, stating:

'Dirtee Disco' is a '70s-influenced party tune on which Dizz raps about doing the robot, drinking JD and Coke and wrapping his hands around the nearest girl's waist over some oh-so-groovy beats. Featuring vocals from none other than One True Voice alumnus and former X Factor hopeful Daniel Pearce, it's more likely to remind you of your local Flares nightclub than the hedonistic heyday of Studio 54. Close to the start of the track, Dizz warns: "If you can't say something nice, then keep quiet." We'd better keep our lips firmly shut then.. 

Music video

In the music video, Rascal and his accomplices enter what appears to be a local village hall where DJ Derek has set up his mobile disco for the benefit of a number of older people. The disco is rather quiet until Rascal enters, then the party really gets started. He is accompanied by a number of attractive girls that are much younger than the other dancers, and all dressed for clubbing. All the older people there are shocked at Rascal and the girls he is with. As the song ends, DJ Derek announces "OK, that was Dizzee Rascal and Dirtee Disco. Some wicked moves out there. Well it's nearly 10 o'clock, and the night is almost over. So it's time to slow things down a bit." DJ Derek then puts on a slow song and everyone waltzes for the remainder of the video.

Rascal told the NME about the video: "There's no Saturday Night Fever influence. That's not John Travolta strutting, that's me, wearing a £2,000 Gucci suit. The moves are more influenced by You Don't Mess with the Zohan. Keep an eye out for the models – I chose them. The video's about being able to have a good time wherever you go, whether it's a club or a church hall."

Passage:
Rocky Top, Tennessee
Rocky Top (formerly Coal Creek and Lake City) is a city in Anderson and Campbell counties in the eastern part of the U.S. state of Tennessee, northwest of Knoxville. The population was 1,781 at the 2010 census.  Most of the community is in Anderson County and is included in the Knoxville Metropolitan Statistical Area. On June 26, 2014, the city officially changed its name from Lake City to Rocky Top, after a last-ditch effort by the owners of the copyright in the song "Rocky Top" was denied by a federal court.

History

Founding as "Coal Creek"

The town was originally named Coal Creek when it was founded in the early 19th century, after the 1798 Treaty of Tellico opened the area to settlement,  taking its name from the stream that runs through the town. Coal Creek and the nearby town of Briceville were the site of a major lockout of coal miners in 1891, which resulted in the town of Coal Creek being occupied by the state militia for over a year after miners attempted to force an end to the use of unpaid convict labor in the mines. This labor struggle, known as the Coal Creek War, was eventually resolved in the coal miners' favor with the abolition of Tennessee's convict labor program. The Fraterville Mine disaster of 1902 occurred nearby, in the village of Fraterville.

Renaming to "Lake City" (1936)

The name "Lake City" was adopted in 1936 after the completion of nearby Norris Dam formed an artificial lake above the dam. Some area residents, including the nonprofit Coal Creek Watershed Foundation, have urged a return to the old name of "Coal Creek" to commemorate the community's heritage.

Renaming to "Rocky Top" (2014)

In 2013, a business group proposed to establish a theme park in the city if the city name was changed to "Rocky Top" to take advantage of the song of that name.  On November 7, 2013, Lake City's city council voted to ask the Tennessee General Assembly to amend the city charter to adopt the proposed name.  The House of Bryant, which owns the copyright to the song, as well as  multiple trademarks and copyrights associated with it, has objected to the name change, asserting that it would violate intellectual property rights.  On May 29, U.S. District Judge Thomas A. Varlan denied the House of Bryant's request for an preliminary injunction, holding that renaming the town was not likely to be deemed to be a use in commerce as required for trademark infringement. 

On June 26, 2014, the city officially changed its name, after Varlan denied a last-minute attempt by House of Bryant to prevent the vote.  House of Bryant's appeal is pending before the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.

Passage:
Lugnaquilla
Lugnaquilla  () is a 925 m tall mountain in County Wicklow, Ireland. 

Geography 

 
The mountain is the highest peak of the Wicklow Mountains range and the highest in Ireland outside County Kerry.  Informally referred to as one of the Irish Munros, it is classed as a Furth by the Scottish Mountaineering Club. 

Lugnaquilla is a bulky mountain, with a large plateau-type summit, bounded on two sides by steep glacial corries called "North Prison" and "South Prison". 

Access to the summit 

Its proximity to Dublin ensures that Lugnaquilla is a frequently climbed mountain. The three popular approaches are from Fenton's Pub in the Glen of Imaal, Glenmalure and Aghavannagh with the shortest direct route from the Glen of Imaal via Camara Hill that skirts the military artillery range. 

Views, on a clear day, extend east across the Irish Sea to the hills of the Llŷn Peninsula and mountains of Snowdonia in Wales, and west to the mountains of Munster.

Passage:
Hendecagon
In geometry, a hendecagon (also undecagon or 11-gon   or endecagon ) is an eleven-sided polygon. (The name hendecagon, from Greek hendeka "eleven" and gon– "corner", is often preferred to the hybrid undecagon, whose first part is formed from Latin undecim "eleven".[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hendecagon.html Hendecagon – from Wolfram MathWorld])

Regular hendecagon

A regular hendecagon is represented by Schläfli symbol {11}.

A regular hendecagon has internal angles of 147.27 degrees.  The area of a regular hendecagon with side length a is given by 
A = \frac{11}{4}a^2 \cot \frac{\pi}{11} \simeq 9.36564\,a^2.

As 11 is not a Fermat prime, the regular hendecagon is not constructible with compass and straightedge.  Because 11 is not a Pierpont prime, construction of a regular hendecagon is still impossible even with the usage of an angle trisector.

Close approximations to the regular hendecagon can be constructed, however. For instance, the ancient Greek mathematicians approximated the side length of a hendecagon inscribed in a unit circle as being 14/25 units long. 

Approximate construction

The following construction is given by T. Drummond from 1800: 
Given a circle with centre B and radius AB, bisect the radius at C, then draw the arcs CDI and AD with CA as radius. From I draw the arc with radius ID, which intersects the original circle at O; CO is approximately the inscribed hendecagon's side length.
On a unit circle:
* Constructed hendecagon side length b=0.563692\ldots
* Theoretical hendecagon side lengtha2\sin(\frac{\pi}{11})
0.563465\ldots
* Absolute error \deltab-a
2.27\ldots\cdot10^{-4} – if AB is 10 m then this error is approximately 2.3 mm.

Symmetry

The regular hendecagon has Dih11 symmetry, order 22. Since 11 is a prime number there is one subgroup with dihedral symmetry: Dih1, and 2 cyclic group symmetries: Z11, and Z1.

These 4 symmetries can be seen in 4 distinct symmetries on the hendecagon. John Conway labels these by a letter and group order.  Full symmetry of the regular form is r22 and no symmetry is labeled a1. The dihedral symmetries are divided depending on whether they pass through vertices (d for diagonal) or edges (p for perpendiculars), and i when reflection lines path through both edges and vertices. Cyclic symmetries in the middle column are labeled as g for their central gyration orders.

Each subgroup symmetry allows one or more degrees of freedom for irregular forms. Only the g11 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can seen as directed edges.

Use in coinage

The Canadian dollar coin, the loonie, is similar to, but not exactly, a regular hendecagonal prism,  as are the Indian 2-rupee coin  and several other lesser-used coins of other nations.  The cross-section of a loonie is actually a Reuleaux hendecagon. The United States Susan B. Anthony dollar has a hendecagonal outline along the inside of its edges.

Bertha Mason
Bertha Antoinetta Mason is a fictional character. In Charlotte Brontë's 1847 novel Jane Eyre she is the violently insane first wife of Edward Rochester, moved to Thornfield Hall and locked in the attic. 

The 1966 parallel novel Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean Rhys acts as a prequel to Brontë's novel and is the story of Mason (there called Antoinette Cosway), from the time of her youth in the Caribbean to her unhappy marriage and relocation to England. Rhys's novel re-imagines Brontë's devilish madwoman in the attic.

Bertha Mason in Jane Eyre 

Bertha Mason is the only daughter of a very wealthy family living in Spanish Town, Jamaica. The reader learns of her past not from her perspective but only through the description of her unhappy husband, Edward Rochester. She is described as being of Creole heritage. According to Rochester, Bertha was famous for her beauty: she was the pride of the town and sought after by many suitors. Upon leaving college, Rochester was persuaded by his father to visit the Mason family and court Bertha. As he tells it, he first met her at a ball she attended with her father and brother Richard, where he was entranced by her loveliness. Despite never being alone with her, and supposedly having had scarcely any interaction or conversation with her, he married her for her wealth and beauty, and with fierce encouragement from his own father and the Mason family. Rochester and Bertha began their lives as husband and wife in Jamaica. In recounting the history of their relationship, Rochester claims, "I thought I loved her. . . . Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she allured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was. Oh, I have no respect for myself when I think of that act! . . . I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not even know her." 

Rochester explains that he was not warned that violent insanity ran in the Mason family and that the past three generations succumbed to it. He assumed Bertha's mother to be dead and was never told otherwise, but she was in fact locked away in an asylum. There was also an intellectually disabled younger brother. Rochester's father knew of this but did not bother to tell his son, caring only about the vast fortune the marriage would bring him, and the Mason family clearly wanted Bertha off their hands as quickly as possible. Rochester asserts that Bertha's mental health deteriorated quickly, though it is unclear which form of mental illness she suffers from. Her insane, violent behaviour becomes frightening to behold: crawling on all fours, snarling, and behaving in a bestial manner. 

Rochester returns with her to England and has her imprisoned in an attic room for ten years with Grace Poole, a hired nurse who keeps her under control while Rochester travels abroad to forget his horrible marriage. However, Grace drinks sometimes, and Bertha manages to escape, causing havoc in the house: starting a fire in Mr Rochester's bed and biting and stabbing her own visiting brother. 

Rochester's marriage to Bertha eventually stands in the way of his marrying Jane Eyre, who is unaware of Bertha's existence and whom he truly loves (though he later admits to Jane that he once thought he loved Bertha). As Bertha is insane he cannot divorce her, due to her actions being uncontrollable and thus not legitimate grounds for divorce.  Years of violence, insanity, and confinement in an attic destroy Bertha's looks: when Jane sees her in the middle of the night, she describes Bertha as looking "savage," even going so far as to compare her with a "vampire"  when she destroys Jane's wedding veil (an action that hints that Bertha is at least sane enough to be aware that her husband is planning to enter a bigamous marriage). Despite not loving her, Rochester attempts to save his wife from an enormous fire she starts in the house when she again escapes. Bertha perishes after she throws herself off the roof, leaving her husband free to marry Jane.

Antoinette Cosway in Wide Sargasso Sea 

In Wide Sargasso Sea, "Bertha Mason" is portrayed as being a false name for Antoinette Cosway. The book purports to tell Antoinette's side of the story as well as Rochester's and detail how she ended up alone and raving in the attic of Thornfield Hall. According to the book, Antoinette's insanity and drunkenness are the result of Rochester's misguided belief that madness is in her blood and that she was part of the scheme to have him married blindly.
 
The characters of Jane Eyre and Antoinette are portrayed as being very similar; independent, vivacious, imaginative young women with troubled childhoods, educated in religious establishments and looked down on by the upper classes — and, of course, they both marry Mr Rochester. However, Antoinette is more rebellious than Jane and less mentally stable. She displays a deep vein of morbidity verging on a death-wish (making her more similar perhaps to the character of Helen from Jane Eyre) and, in contrast with Jane's overt Christianity, holds a cynical viewpoint of both God and religion in general.
