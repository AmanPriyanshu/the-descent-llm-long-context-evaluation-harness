Passage:
United Nations Day
United Nations Day is devoted to making known to peoples of the world the aims and achievements of the United Nations Organization. United Nations Day is part of United Nations Week, which runs from 20 to 26 October.

In 1948, the United Nations General Assembly declared 24 October, the anniversary of the Charter of the United Nations, as which "shall be devoted to making known to the peoples of the world the aims and achievements of the United Nations and to gaining their support for" its work. 

In 1971 the United Nations General Assembly adopted a further resolution (United Nations Resolution 2782) declaring that United Nations Day shall be an international holiday and recommended that it should be observed as a public holiday by all United Nations member states. 

Commemoration

U.N. Day has traditionally been marked throughout the world with meetings, discussions and exhibits about the achievements and goals of the organization. In 1971, the General Assembly recommended that member states observe it as a public holiday.

Several international schools throughout the world also celebrate the diversity of their student body on United Nations Day (although the event is not necessarily celebrated on 24 October). Celebrations often include a show of cultural performances in the evening and a food fair, where food is available from all over the world.

In the United States, the President has issued a proclamation each year for United Nations Day since 1946. The most recent such proclamation was issued by Barack Obama. 

In Kosovo, United Nations Day is an official non-working day as the province is administered by the Interim Administration Mission.

In the Philippines, local schoolchildren customarily dress in the national costumes of member states and hold a programme on U.N. Day, which is the last school day before semestral break. Individual students, classes, or grade levels are assigned a country to represent and study; students handcraft their assigned country's flag, and prepare cultural presentations and food as part of the day's educational activities.

World Development Information Day

The UN's World Development Information Day has also been held on 24 October since 1972.

Yes, you read that right: ham, cheese, and French toast.
Inspired by the French croque-monsieur, Monte Cristo kicks the classic ham and cheese sandwich up a notch with the distinct savory graininess of Gruyère and the egg-y richness of French toast. To really bring out the nuance of its various flavors, though, it’s crucial to forego the temptingly easy microwave route and take the time to grill it in a pan. You know it’s worth it when you nibble the burnt pieces of cheese along the edges of the buttery, non-soggy toast and relish the gooey center of every bite. The only drawback might be that, once you’ve made it for yourself, the D’fo version will be all the more disappointing.

Prep Time: 3 minutes (excluding French toast prep)
Cook Time: 6-8 minutes
Total Time: About 10 minutes

Ingredients:
2 slices uncooked, aka still soggy, French toast (use your own recipe or our 5-minute one – see tips at the bottom of the directions)
Optional: extra French toast liquid mixture
Dijon mustard
2 slices ham (or 1 slice ham and 1 slice turkey)
A little over ¼ cup shredded Gruyère or Swiss cheese (see tips at the bottom of the directions)
Butter
To serve: powdered sugar, maple syrup, or preserves
Directions:
1. Smear toast with as much or little mustard as you like.

6. Melt a pat of butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. If you have the optional French toast mixture, dunk the entire sandwich in it for some extra decadence.
7. Grill the sandwich for 4 minutes on each side, covered for the first minute and a half and uncovered the rest of the time. Serve with any of the suggested toppings or plain.

Tips:
1. If you want your sandwich to be savory only, leave out the cinnamon, extracts, sugar, etc. that your French toast recipe calls for. The point is to have egg-y bread.
2. Gruyère is the Monte Cristo standard, but Swiss is the easiest to come by and much cheaper. Some other options are Jarlsberg, Emmentaler, Comte, Beaufort, and Raclette. For a unique, non-traditional take, try using brie.
3. Brown the sandwich well to make sure the egg is fully cooked (unless you find the risk of salmonella exciting).

Passage:
Tui (bird)
The tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae) is an endemic passerine bird of New Zealand. It is one of the largest members of the diverse honeyeater family. The name tui is from the Māori name tūī and is the species' formal common name. The plural is tui in modern English, or ngā tūī in Māori usage;  some speakers still use the '-s' suffix to produce the Anglicised form tuis to indicate plurality, but this practice is becoming less common.   The early European colonists called it the parson bird,  but, as with many New Zealand birds, the Maori name tui is now the common name and the English term is archaic. 

Description

At first glance the bird appears completely black except for a small tuft of white feathers at its neck and a small white wing patch, causing it to resemble a parson in clerical attire. On closer inspection (see image) it can be seen that tui have brown feathers on the back and flanks, a multicoloured iridescent sheen that varies with the angle from which the light strikes them, and a dusting of small, white-shafted feathers on the back and sides of the neck that produce a lacy collar.

Distribution and habitat

Tui are found through much of New Zealand, particularly the North Island, the west and south coasts of the South Island, Stewart Island/Rakiura and the Chatham Islands—where an endangered sub-species particular to these islands exists. Other populations live on Raoul Island in the Kermadecs,  and in the Auckland Islands (where, with the New Zealand bellbird, it is the most southerly species of honeyeater).  Populations have declined considerably since European settlement, mainly as a result of widespread habitat destruction and predation by mammalian invasive species.

Nonetheless, the species is considered secure and has made recoveries in some areas, particularly after removal of livestock has allowed vegetation to recover. Predation by introduced species remains a threat, particularly stoats, the common myna (which compete with tui for food and sometimes takes eggs), and rats.

Tui prefer broadleaf forests below 1500 metres, but will tolerate quite small remnant patches, regrowth, exotic plantations and well-vegetated suburbs. They are one of the most common birds found in urban Wellington. They are usually seen singly, in pairs, or in small family groups, but will congregate in large numbers at suitable food sources, often in company with silvereyes, bellbirds, or kererū (New Zealand wood pigeon) in any combination. Generally, when interspecific competition for the same food resources among New Zealand's three species of honeyeater occurs, there is a hierarchy with the tui at the top, then bellbirds and stitchbirds successively subordinate to the species above them—they are thus frequently chased off by tui at a food source such as a flowering flax plant.

Behaviour and ecology

Male tui can be extremely aggressive, chasing all other birds (large and small) from their territory with loud flapping and sounds akin to rude human speech. This is especially true of other tui when possession of a favoured feeding tree is impinged. Birds will often erect their body feathers in order to appear larger in an attempt to intimidate a rival. They have even been known to mob harriers and magpies.

The powered flight of tui is quite loud as they have developed short wide wings, giving excellent maneuverability in the dense forest they prefer, but requiring rapid flapping. They can be seen to perform a mating display of rising at speed in a vertical climb in clear air, before stalling and dropping into a powered dive, then repeating. Much of this behaviour is more notable during the breeding season of early spring—September and October. Females alone build nests of twigs, grasses and mosses.

Feeding

Nectar is the normal diet but fruit and insects are frequently eaten, and pollen and seeds more occasionally. Particularly popular is the New Zealand flax, whose nectar sometimes ferments, resulting in the tui flying in a fashion that suggests that they might be drunk. They are the main pollinators of flax, kowhai, kaka beak and some other plants. Note that the flowers of the three plants mentioned are similar in shape to the tui's beak—a vivid example of mutualistic coevolution. 

Songs and calls

Tui are considered to be very intelligent, much like parrots.  They also resemble parrots in their ability to clearly imitate human speech,  and were trained by Māori to replicate complex speech.  Tui are also known for their noisy, unusual call, different for each individual, that combine bellbird-like notes with clicks, cackles, timber-like creaks and groans, and wheezing sounds. Songbirds have two voiceboxes  and this is what enables them to perform such a myriad of vocalisations. Tui song also exhibits geographical, microgeographic, seasonal, sex and individual variation.    

Some of the wide range of tui sounds are beyond the human register. Watching a tui sing, one can observe gaps in the sound when the beak is agape and throat tufts throbbing. However, ongoing research has so far failed to detect ultrasound within tui vocalisations. Tui will also sing at night, especially around the full moon period.

Passage:
Beau Geste
Beau Geste is an adventure novel by P. C. Wren, which details the adventures of three English brothers who enlist separately in the French Foreign Legion following the theft of a valuable jewel from the country house of a relative. While written in 1924 the novel is set in the period before World War I. It has been adapted for the screen several times.

Plot summary

Michael "Beau" Geste is the protagonist. The main narrator is his younger brother John. The three Geste brothers are portrayed as behaving according to the British upper class values of a time gone by, and "the decent thing to do" is, in fact, the leitmotif of the novel. The Geste brothers are orphans and have been brought up by their aloof aunt Lady Patricia at Brandon Abbas. The rest of Beau's band are mainly Isobel and Claudia (apparently illegitimate daughter of Lady Patricia) and Lady Patricia's relative Augustus (caddish nephew of the absent Sir Hector Brandon). John and Isobel are devoted to each other and it is in part to spare her any suspicion of being a thief that he takes the extreme step of joining the Foreign Legion.

When a precious jewel known as the "Blue Water" goes missing, suspicion falls on the young people, and Beau leaves Britain to join the French Foreign Legion in Algeria, followed by his brothers, Digby (his twin) and John. After recruit training in Sidi Bel Abbes and some active service skirmishing with tribesmen in the south, John and Beau are posted to the little garrison of the desert outpost of Fort Zinderneuf in the French Soudan. Their commander there is the sadistic Sergeant Major Lejaune who drives his abused subordinates to the verge of mutiny. Only an attack by Tuaregs prevents mass desertion (only the Geste brothers and a few loyals are against the plot). Throughout the book and adventures, Beau's behaviour is true to France and the Legion, and he dies at his post. Digby, detached for service with mule−mounted infantry and part of the relief column that reaches Fort Zindeneuf, is subsequently killed in a skirmish. 

At Brandon Abbas, the last survivor of the three brothers, John, is welcomed by their aunt and his fiancée Isobel, and the reason for the jewel theft is revealed to have been a matter of honour, and to have been the only "decent thing" possible.

Title

The phrase "beau geste" is from the French, meaning "a gracious (or fine) gesture". 

In French, the phrase includes the suggestion of a fine gesture with unwelcome or futile consequences, and an allusion to the chanson de geste, a literary poem celebrating the legendary deeds of a hero. 

Sequels

P.C. Wren wrote the sequels Beau Sabreur (in which the narrator is a French officer of Spahis who plays a secondary role in "Beau Geste")  and Beau Ideal. He also wrote Good Gestes, a collection of short tales (about half of them about the Geste brothers and their American friends Hank and Buddy, who also feature prominently in Beau Sabreur and Beau Ideal) and Spanish Maine (UK) or The Desert Heritage (USA), where loose ends are tied up and the successive tales of John Geste's adventures come to an end. Life in the Foreign Legion is represented in five different volumes.    

Analysis

The original novel, on which the various films are more or less loosely based, provides a detailed and fairly authentic description of life in the pre-1914 Foreign Legion, which has led to (unproven) suggestions that P. C. Wren himself served with the Legion. Before he became a successful writer Wren's recorded career was that of a school teacher in India. 

Adaptations

* Beau Geste (1926), starring Ronald Colman, William Powell, Noah Beery
* Beau Geste (1939), with Gary Cooper, Ray Milland, Robert Preston
* Beau Geste (1966), with Guy Stockwell, Doug McClure, Telly Savalas
* Beau Geste (1982 BBC serial), starring Benedict Taylor, Anthony Calf, Jonathon Morris

Beau Geste was also adapted for the stage in 1929 by British theatrical producer Basil Dean. The production featured Laurence Olivier in the lead role. The play ran for just five weeks. 

Parodies 

* Beau Hunks 1931, a 1931 movie starring Laurel and Hardy.
* The Goon Show episode "Under Two Floorboards (A Story of the Legion)" (broadcast January 25, 1955)
* Follow that Camel (1967) A Carry on film featuring a character called B. O. West.
* The Generation Game (around 1975) did a parody of Beau Geste, may have been the first to use the name Beau Peep.
* The Last Remake of Beau Geste (1977), starring Marty Feldman, Ann-Margret and Michael York
* Beau Peep (started 1978) a strip cartoon in the Daily Star newspaper.
* Soul Music (1994), by Terry Pratchett. The Death of the Discworld uses the name Beau Nidle and has him join the Klatchian Foreign Legion, a parody of the French Foreign Legion.
* The comic strip Crock claims to be "the greatest and longest-running parody" of Beau Geste,  although it bears little similarity to the original novel.
* Snoopy from the Peanuts comic strip frequently refers to Fort Zinderneuf when roleplaying as a Foreign Legionnaire.
Question:
Who wrote the 1924 adventure novel ‘Beau Geste’?
Answer:
P C Wren
Passage:
Thio-
The prefix thio-, when applied to a chemical, such as an ion, means that an oxygen atom in the compound has been replaced by a sulfur atom.  This term is often used in organic chemistry.  For example, from the word ether, referring to an oxygen-containing compound having the general chemical structure R–O–R′, where R and R′ are organic functional groups and O is an oxygen atom, comes the word thioether, which refers to an analogous compound with the general structure R–S–R′, where S is a sulfur atom covalently bonded to two organic groups.  A chemical reaction involving the replacement of oxygen to sulfur is called thionation or thiation.

Thio- can be prefixed with di- and tri- in chemical nomenclature.

The word derives from Greek  theîon = "sulfur" (which occurs in Greek epic poetry as  théweion and may come from the same root as Latin fumus (Indo-European dh-w) and may have originally meant "fumigation substance".)

Examples

* Thioamide
* Thiocyanate
* Thioether
* Thioketone
* Thiol
* Thiophene
* Thiourea
* Thiosulfate
Question:
The prefix “thio” indicates the presence of which chemical element?
Answer:
Sulpher

Passage:
Campanula
For the main belt asteroid, see 1077 Campanula. The hydrozoan genus Campanula is usually included in Campanularia today.

Campanula  is one of several genera  in the family Campanulaceae with the common name bellflower. It takes both its common and its scientific name from its bell-shaped flowers—campanula is Latin for "little bell".

The genus includes over 500 species and several subspecies, distributed across the temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with the highest diversity in the Mediterranean region east to the Caucasus.  The range also extends into mountains in tropical regions of Asia and Africa. 

The species include annual, biennial and perennial plants, and vary in habit from dwarf arctic and alpine species under 5 cm high, to large temperate grassland and woodland species growing to 2 m tall.

Description

The leaves are alternate and often vary in shape on a single plant, with larger, broader leaves at the base of the stem and smaller, narrower leaves higher up; the leaf margin may be either entire or serrated (sometimes both on the same plant). Many species contain white latex in the leaves and stems.[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id
2&taxon_id=105395 Flora of China, v 19 p 530, 风铃草属 feng ling cao shu, Campanula Linnaeus, Sp. Pl. 1: 163. 1753. ]

The flowers are produced in panicles (sometimes solitary), and have a  five-lobed corolla, typically large (2–5 cm or more long), mostly blue to purple, sometimes white or pink. Below the corolla, 5 leaf-like sepals form the calyx. Some species have a small additional leaf-like growth termed an "appendage" between each sepal, and the presence or absence, relative size, and attitude of the appendage is often used to distinguish between closely related species.

The fruit is a capsule containing numerous small seeds.

Campanula species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Common Pug (recorded on Harebell), Dot Moth, Ingrailed Clay (recorded on Harebell), Lime-speck Pug and Mouse Moth.

Cultivation and uses

Well-known species include the northern temperate Campanula rotundifolia, commonly known as harebell in England and bluebell in Scotland and Ireland (though it is not closely related to the true bluebells), and the southern European Campanula medium, commonly known as Canterbury bells (a popular garden plant in the United Kingdom).  As well as several species occurring naturally in the wild in northern Europe, there are many cultivated garden species.

The cultivars 'Burghaltii'  and 'Kent Belle'  have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

The species Campanula rapunculus, commonly known as rampion bellflower, rampion, or rover bellflower, is a biennial vegetable which was once widely grown in Europe for its spinach-like leaves and radish-like roots.   The Brothers Grimm's tale Rapunzel took its name from this plant.

In the UK the National Collection of campanulas is held at Burton Agnes Hall in East Yorkshire and the National Collection of Alpine Campanulas at Langham Hall in Suffolk.

Related genera

The classification of some Campanulaceae genera as either part of Campanula or separate genera can vary by system, including Azorina, Campanulastrum, Canarina, Edraianthus, Musschia, Ostrowskia, and Platycodon. Some genera previously not segregated from Campanula currently are segregated in some systems, including Annaea, Gadellia, and Theodorovia. Hemisphaera was formerly Campanula, subsect. Scapiflorae, and Neocodon was Campanula sect. Rapunculus. 

Species

There are 473, including:
