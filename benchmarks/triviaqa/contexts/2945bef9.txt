Passage:
Mora–Siljan Airport
"MXX" redirects here. It is also the Roman numeral for 1020.

Mora–Siljan Airport , is located about 7 km or 3.3 NM southwest of Mora, Sweden. Its Fixed-Base Operator (FBO), AB Dalaflyget, which also operates the Dala Airport, is constituted of the municipalities of Mora, Falun, Borlänge and the Dalarna County, in Central Sweden. Dalaflyget also provides the air traffic control services. The 45 m wide runway and parking can accommodate Boeing 737-type airliners.

Two flights operate to Arlanda on weekdays (three on Thursdays), and one on Sundays, in approximately 50 minutes. Since 2011, Avies operates the line with a 19-seater Jetstream 32 turboprop aircraft. Nearby the airfield also houses the Ovansiljans Flygklubb.

The number of passengers dramatically fell from about 50,000 passengers per year in the 1980s to 7,000 in recent years, following a trend experienced during this period by all Swedish third-level airports. Cutthroat competition between two domestic airlines, Skyways Express and the defunct European Executive Express came to an end in 2005, leaving the area without flight to Stockholm and the outside world, requiring a 4-hour drive. The Mora municipality managed the airport before Dalaflyget was established.

Passage:
Pyrophobia
Pyrophobia  is an irrational fear of fire, beyond what is considered normal. This phobia is ancient and primordial, perhaps since mankind's discovery of fire. 

Causes

The most common cause of pyrophobia is that fire poses a potential danger, such as house fire, wildfire, and getting caught on fire. Some people who are intensely pyrophobic cannot even get close to or tolerate even a small controlled fire, such as fireplace, bonfire or lit candle. In many cases a bad childhood experience with fire may have triggered the condition.

Symptoms

If a pyrophobe sees fire, the person may sweat and suffer dizziness or upset stomach. A person with severe pyrophobia who sees fire may panic and experience fast breathing, irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath, nausea, dry mouth, dread, feeling trapped, and may tremble or faint. 

Treatment

Exposure therapy is the most common way to treat pyrophobia. This method involves showing patients fires in order of increasing size, from a lit cigarette up to a stove or grill flame.

Another method of treatment is talk therapy, in which a patient tells a therapist about the cause of this fear. This can calm the patient to make them less afraid of controlled fire.

People can relieve pyrophobia by interacting with other pyrophobes to share their experiences that caused fear. Alternatively, pyrophobia can be treated using hypnosis.

Medication can also be used to treat pyrophobic people, although since it has side effects, the method is not highly recommended.
Question:
'Pyrophobia' is the fear of what?
Answer:
Open flame
Passage:
Wingspan
The wingspan (or just span) of a bird or an airplane is the distance from one wingtip to the other wingtip. For example, the Boeing 777 has a wingspan of about 60 m; and a wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans) caught in 1965 had a wingspan of , the official record for a living bird.

The term wingspan, more technically extent, is also used for other winged animals such as pterosaurs, bats, insects, etc., and other fixed-wing aircraft such as ornithopters.

Wingspan of aircraft

The wingspan of an aircraft is always measured in a straight line, from wingtip to wingtip, independently of wing shape or sweep.

Implications for aircraft design and animal evolution

The lift from wings is proportional to their area, so the heavier the animal or aircraft the bigger that area must be.  The area is the product of the span times the width (mean chord) of the wing, so either a long, narrow wing or a shorter, broader wing will support the same mass.  For efficient steady flight, the ratio of span to chord, the aspect ratio, should be as high as possible (the constraints are usually structural) because this lowers the lift-induced drag associated with the inevitable wingtip vortices. Long-ranging birds, like albatrosses, and most commercial aircraft maximize aspect ratio.  Alternatively, animals and aircraft which depend on maneuverability (fighters, predators and the predated, and those who live amongst trees and bushes, insect catchers, etc.) need to be able to roll fast to turn, and the high moment of inertia of long narrow wings produces lower roll rates.  For them, short-span, broad wings are preferred.

The highest aspect ratio man-made wings are aircraft propellers, in their most extreme form as helicopter rotors.

Wingspan of flying animals

To measure the wingspan of a bird, a live or freshly-dead specimen is placed flat on its back, the wings are grasped at the wrist joints, ankles and the distance is measured between the tips of the longest primary feathers on each wing.

The wingspan of an insect refers to the wingspan of pinned specimens, and may refer to the distance between the centre of the thorax to the apex of the wing doubled or to the width between the apices with the wings set with the trailing wing edge perpendicular to the body.

Wingspan in sports

In basketball and gridiron football, a fingertip-to-fingertip measurement is used to determine the player's wingspan, also called armspan. This is called reach in boxing terminology.  The wingspan of 16-year-old BeeJay Anya, a top basketball Junior Class of 2013 prospect who now plays for the NC State Wolfpack, was officially measured at 7 feet, 9 inches across, one of the longest of all National Basketball Association draft prospects, and the longest ever for a non-7-foot player.  The wingspan of Manute Bol, at 8 ft, is (as of 2013) the longest in NBA history, and his vertical reach was 10 ft.

The Release of – Herring: A History of the Silver Darlings     Published:  24 May, 2011
The history of the herring and those whose lives have been devoted to getting it to the tables of the masses.
The story of herring is entwined in the history of commercial fishing. For over two millennia, herring have been commercially caught and its importance to the coastal peoples of Britain cannot be measured. At one point tens of thousands were involved in the catching, processing and sale of herring. They followed the shoals around the coast from Stornoway to Penzance and many towns on Britains East Coast grew rich on the backs of the silver darlings.
Fishing historian Mike Smylie looks at the effects of herring on the people who caught them, their unique ways of life, the superstitions of the fisher folk, their boats and the communities who lived for the silver darlings.  The trouble with Herring is that it doesnt have a good public image.   It was regarded once as food of the poor and fresh Herring is considered to be bony and unpalatable. If the British public were persuaded to eat at least two Herring a week then there would almost certainly be an improvement in the publics health.
The book includes:
* Revealing the fascinating yet little-known history of the herring.
* Documenting its importance and versatility.
* Illustrated with a variety of maps and photographs, both black and white and colour.
* Mouth watering recipes including Baked Buttered Bloaters, Salmagundy and Super Sgadan.
Mike Smylie, also known as Kipperman, has been researching the history of the herring for nearly three decades. He has written extensively on fishing vessels and the fishing industry, including Fishing Around Morecambe Bay,  Fishing in Cornwall and Fishing the European Coast for The History Press. He divides his time between Bristol and Greece and can often be spotted at fishing festivals manning his herring smoker.

Passage:
Petersen House
The Petersen House is a 19th-century federal style row house located at 516 10th Street NW in Washington, D.C. On April 15, 1865, United States President Abraham Lincoln died there after being shot the previous evening at Ford's Theatre located across the street. The house was built in 1849 by William A. Petersen, a German tailor. Future Vice-President John C. Breckinridge, a friend of the Lincoln family, once rented this house in 1852. 

Lincoln assassination

On the night of April 14, 1865, Lincoln and his wife Mary Todd were attending a performance of Our American Cousin when John Wilkes Booth, an actor and Southern sympathizer, entered the box and shot the President in the back of the head. Henry Rathbone and Clara Harris were also in the box with the Lincolns, and Rathbone suffered stab wounds. Attendants including Charles Leale and Charles Sabin Taft examined Lincoln in the box before having him carried across the street to the Petersen House, where boarder Henry Safford directed them inside.http://www.fordstheatre.org/home/performances-events/tours/petersen-house

Almarin Cooley Richards, superintendent of the Washington Metropolitan Police, was attending the performance and immediately began investigations. From the back parlor of the house, Richards interviewed witnesses and ordered the arrest of Booth.http://www.thespectrum.com/article/20090210/LIFESTYLE/902100325

Physicians continually removed blood clots which formed over the wound and poured out the excess brain fluid and brain matter from where the bullet had entered Lincoln's head in order to relieve pressure on the brain. However, the external and internal hemorrhaging continued throughout the night.

During the night and early morning, guards patrolled outside to prevent onlookers from coming inside the house. Lincoln's Cabinet members, Generals, and various members of Congress were allowed to see the President.

Lincoln died in the house on April 15, 1865, at 7:22 a.m., age 56.  Individuals in the room when he died included his son Robert Todd Lincoln, Senator Charles Sumner, generals Henry Wager Halleck, Richard James Oglesby and Montgomery C. Meigs, and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.

Today

Since 1933, the National Park Service has maintained it as a historical museum, recreating the scene at the time of Lincoln's death. The bed that Lincoln occupied and other items from the bedroom had been bought by Chicago collector, Charles F. Gunther, and are now owned by and on display at the Chicago History Museum.   However, replicas have taken their places.  The bloodstained pillow and pillowcases are the ones used by Lincoln.  

Today, the Petersen House is administered by the National Park Service as part of the Ford's Theatre National Historic Site.  Usually the house is open to visitors daily from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.  Admission is free, but requires a time ticket.

Passage:
Woodwind instrument
Woodwind instruments  are a family of musical instruments within the more general category of wind instruments.  There are two main types of woodwind instruments:  flutes and reed instruments (otherwise called reed pipes). What differentiates these instruments from other wind instruments is the way in which they produce their sound.  Examples are a saxophone, a bassoon, piccolo and others.

Flutes

Flutes produce sound by directing a focused stream of air across the edge of a hole in a cylindrical tube.  The flute family can be divided into two sub-families: open flutes, and closed flutes. 

To produce a sound with open flutes, the player is required to blow a stream of air across a sharp edge that then splits the airstream .  This split airstream then acts upon the air column contained within the flute's hollow causing it to vibrate and produce sound.  Examples of open flutes are the transverse flute, panpipes and ocarinas.  Ancient flutes of this variety were often made from tubular sections of plants such as grasses, reeds, and hollowed-out tree branches. Later, flutes were made of metals such as tin, copper, or bronze. Modern concert flutes are usually made of high-grade metal alloys, usually containing nickel, silver, copper, or gold. 

To produce a sound with a closed flute, the player is required to blow air into a duct.  This duct acts as a channel bringing the air to a sharp edge.  As with the open flutes, the air is then split; this causes the column of air within the closed flute to vibrate and produce sound.  Examples of this type of flute include the recorder, and organ pipes. 

Reed instruments

Reed instruments produce sound by focusing air into a mouthpiece which then causes a reed, or reeds, to vibrate.  Similar to flutes, Reed pipes are also further divided into two types: single reed and double reed.   

Single-reed woodwinds produce sound by placing a reed onto the opening of a mouthpiece (using a ligature).  When air is forced between the reed and the mouthpiece, the reed causes the air column in the instrument to vibrate and produce its unique sound. Single reed instruments include the clarinet, saxophone, and others such as the chalumeau.  

Double-reed instruments use two precisely cut, small pieces of cane bound together at the base.  This form of sound production has been estimated to have originated in the middle to late Neolithic period; its discovery has been attributed to the observation of wind blowing through a split rush.   The finished, bound reed is inserted into the instrument and vibrates as air is forced between the two pieces (again, causing the air within the instrument to vibrate as well).   This family of reed pipes is subdivided further into another two sub-families: exposed double reed, and capped double reed instruments. 
 
Exposed double-reed instruments are played by having the double reed directly between the player's lips.  This family includes instruments such as the oboe, cor anglais (also called English horn) and bassoon, and many types of shawms throughout the world.

On the other hand, Capped double-reed instruments have the double reed covered by a cap.  The player  blows through a hole in this cap that then directs the air through the reeds. This family includes the crumhorn.

Bagpipes are unique reed pipe instruments since they use two or more double or single reeds.  However, bagpipes are functionally the same as a capped double reed instruments since the reeds are never in direct contact with player's lips. 

Free reed aerophone instruments are likewise unique since sound is produced by 'free reeds' –  small metal tongues arranged in rows within a metal or wooden frame.  The airflow necessary for the instruments sound is generated either by a players breath (e.g. harmonica), or by bellows (e.g. accordion).  

Modern orchestra and concert band woodwinds 

The modern orchestra's woodwind section typically includes: flutes, oboes, clarinets, and bassoons. The piccolo, cor anglais, bass clarinet, and contrabassoon are commonly used supplementary woodwind instruments. The section may also on occasion be expanded by the addition of saxophone(s).

The concert band's woodwind section is typically much larger and more diverse than the orchestra's. The concert band's woodwind section typically includes: piccolo, flutes, oboes, B clarinets, bass clarinets, bassoons, alto saxophones, tenor saxophone, and baritone saxophone. The cor anglais, E clarinet, alto clarinet, contra-alto clarinet, contrabass clarinet, contrabassoon, and soprano saxophone are also used, but not as frequently as the other woodwinds.
Question:
What is the smallest woodwind instrument in an orchestra?
Answer:
Piccolo

Denis Lawson
Denis Stamper Lawson  (born 27 September 1947) is a Scottish actor and director. He is known for his roles as John Jarndyce in the BBC's adaptation of Bleak House, as Gordon Urquhart in the film Local Hero, as DI Steve McAndrew in BBC One's New Tricks, and as Wedge Antilles in the original Star Wars trilogy. He is the uncle of actor Ewan McGregor.

Early life

Lawson was born in Crieff, Perthshire, the son of Phyllis Neno (née Stamper), a merchant, and Laurence Lawson, a watchmaker. Lawson was educated at Crieff Primary School (then called Crieff Public School). After the Control examination (Scottish equivalent of the 11 Plus examination), he went on to Morrison's Academy before attending the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, having first unsuccessfully auditioned for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. He then sold carpets and did amateur theatre work for a year in Dundee before auditioning again at RADA in London and successfully at RSAMD in Glasgow. 

Career

Lawson began his acting career with a small role in a 1969 stage production of The Metamorphosis in London's West End. and has since starred in television dramas such as The Merchant of Venice (1973) opposite Laurence Olivier as Shylock, Rock Follies (1976) and Dead Head (1986).

Lawson played X-wing pilot Wedge Antilles in all three films of the original Star Wars trilogy. In 2001, he reprised the role, in voiceover form, for the Nintendo GameCube game Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader.

He has appeared often on the West End stage, notably in the musical Mr. Cinders at the Fortune Theatre from 1983–84. 

In 1999, Lawson directed a production of Little Malcolm & His Struggle Against the Eunuchs which was first staged at the Hampstead Theatre before transferring to the Comedy Theatre in London's West End starring his nephew Ewan McGregor in the lead role of Malcolm Scrawdyke.

Hans Christian Andersen statue to be 'buried' in harbour
Danish sculptor Jens Galschiot to submerge monument in city harbour, with plans to raise it again to mark author's birthday
Galschiot's statue of Hans Christian Andersen, adorned with notice announcing forthcoming 'funeral'
Close
This article is 5 years old
It is, perhaps, a fitting ending for the author of The Little Mermaid: a statue of Hans Christian Andersen is set to be drowned in a Danish harbour by its sculptor.
Artist Jens Galschiot 's bronze sculpture of the fairytale author has stood in Odense town square for the last five years. According to Galschiot, the city was planning to make it part of The Storyteller's Fountain, a larger sculpture intended to be placed in the centre of Odense, honouring the Danish author by recreating the stories he wrote.
Money was raised for the project by a common collection committee, the city council and a local fund, says Galschiot, but the financial crisis meant the fund collapsed, and the council's proposal to place the sculpture in a location away from the city centre was rejected for being "unsuitable". "The Storyteller's Fountain was intended as an interactive sculpture, which requires a certain amount of people passing by, which again requires a certain amount of daily activity or 'life' and not some empty pier," said Galschiot.
Now the artist is intending to bury the 10-foot statue in Odense harbor on 8 October, leaving its head still visible from the pier."At one point the culture department talked about placing the sculpture by Odense harbour in order to attract tourists to the area. Now that the project is definitively suspended, I think I will comply with their wish – maybe not in the way that they had expected but on the other hand, it won't cost them anything," he said. "I think it is a very suitable ending to put The Storyteller's Fountain to rest by creating a new story."
The drowning, where "grieving locals" will be served "funeral beer", will not be the end of the statue's story, however: Galschiot is hoping to resurrect the author's likeness on his birthday, 2 April, next year, and for the burial and resurrection of Andersen to become an annual tradition in the city. "We can drive him to the city centre where he can gaze upon the city for a week or so, and then he will probably be reburied," he said.
He does not expect support for his plans from the local council, however. "They will probably hate me, since the happening really portrays the bureaucracy in a poor way. But I do believe and hope that the 'resurrection' or exhumation will be a recurring event," he said. "Lots of people, who are sad that the sculpture is leaving its current placement in the town square, will be glad to see it return."
But he's not sure Andersen, a shy and reclusive man, would have approved. "To be honest I don't think he would like it since he didn't care much for happenings, although he did like bathing a lot, so maybe he wouldn't be that dissatisfied," said Galschiot. "It would also allow for him to keep an eye on the mermaids." A statue of Andersen's fairytale creation The Little Mermaid already exists in Copenhagen harbour – above the waves.
Question:
The 'Little Mermaid' memorial to Hans Christian Andersen is located where?
Answer:
Copenhagen Harbour

Ciampino–G. B. Pastine International Airport
Ciampino–G. B. Pastine International Airport ()  or simply Rome Ciampino Airport, is the secondary international airport of Rome, the capital of Italy, behind Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport. It is a joint civilian, commercial and military airport situated  south southeast of central Rome, just outside the Greater Ring Road (Italian: Grande Raccordo Anulare or GRA) the circular motorway around the city. The airport serves as a base for Ryanair and general aviation traffic.

The airport will be closed to all traffic from 14 October to 29 October 2016 in order for upgrading work to be conducted. During those days some flights will be operated to/from Fiumicino Airport and others will be cancelled.

History

Ciampino Airport was opened in 1916 and is one of the oldest airports still in operation.

During World War II, the airport was captured by Allied forces in June 1944, and afterward became a United States Army Air Forces military airfield. Although primarily used as a transport base by C-47 Skytrain aircraft of the 64th Troop Carrier Group, the Twelfth Air Force 86th Bombardment Group flew A-36 Apache combat aircraft from the airport during the immediate period after its capture from German forces.

When the combat units moved out, Air Transport Command used the airport as a major transshipment hub for cargo, transiting aircraft and personnel for the remainder of the war. 

It was Rome's main airport until 1960, with traffic amounting to over 2 million passengers per year. After the opening of Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport, Ciampino handled almost exclusively charter and executive flights for more than three decades. However, the terminal facilities were extended at the beginning of 2007 to accommodate the growing number of low-cost carrier operations.

Facilities

The airport features a single, one-storey passenger terminal building containing the departures and arrivals facilities. The departures area consists of a main hall with some stores and service facilities as well as 31 check-in counters and 16 departure gates using walk or bus boarding as there are no jet-bridges. The arrivals area has a separate entrance and features four baggage belts as well as some more service counters.  

The airport hosts a fleet of Bombardier 415 aerial firefighting aircraft.  It is also used by express logistics companies such as DHL, by official flights of the Italian Government and by planes of dignitaries visiting the Italian capital. There is also an additional smaller general aviation terminal, although private flights have now mainly been transferred to Rome Urbe Airport.

Airlines and destinations

The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights to and from Ciampino Airport: 

Statistics

After decades of stagnation in scheduled traffic, low-cost carriers have boosted Ciampino; it is now one of the busiest and fastest growing airports in Italy. Passenger traffic in 2007 was 5,402,000 (9.24% up from 2006; 2006 itself had seen an increase of 16.75% compared to 2005).[http://www.adr.it/datitraffico.asp?L3&idMen
193&scalo=CIA Traffic data] Traffic has grown so much that noise complaints are now forcing the Italian Ministry of Transport to look for a third airport for Rome, which could take over some part of the excess traffic of Ciampino. Passenger traffic in 2008 was 4,788,931 with a decrease of 11.31% compared to 2007 due to economic crisis and EasyJet gradually moving routes to Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport. In 2014, passenger traffic amounted to 5,018,289, and in 2015 the airport handled 5,834,201 passengers.

Ground transportation

There are direct bus connections both to Roma Termini railway station and to close local stations (either to Anagnina, served by the metro or to Ciampino railway station, served by trains to Rome Termini station and other destinations, including Frosinone, Albano Laziale and Potenza.
* COTRAL/Schiaffini operates buses from outside the terminal building to both Anagnina metro station and Ciampino railway station every 15 minutes.
* Bus operators Terravision ltd, Schiaffini and BusShuttle run a direct service to Roma Termini, travel time is about 40 minutes.
* Taxis and rental cars are available at the airport.

Accidents and incidents

* Defects in the design of the de Havilland Comet jet airliner were discovered as the result of inflight breakups on two Comets that departed from Ciampino:
** On 10 January 1954, BOAC Flight 781, a de Havilland Comet, broke up in mid air and crashed into the Mediterranean twenty minutes after takeoff from Ciampino Airport, en route to London Heathrow Airport.
** On 8 April 1954, two weeks after Comets were allowed to resume flying following a temporary grounding resulting from the previous crash, South African Airways Flight 201, another Comet, broke up shortly after takeoff and crashed not far from Ponza.
* On 21 December 1959, Vickers Viscount I-LIZT of Alitalia crashed short of the runway on a training flight exercise in landing with two engines inoperative. Both people on board were killed.
* On 10 November 2008, Ryanair Flight 4102 from Hahn suffered damage during landing. The cause of the accident was stated to be birdstrikes affecting both engines. The port undercarriage of the Boeing 737-8AS collapsed. The aircraft involved was Boeing 737-8AS EI-DYG, delivered new to Ryanair from Boeing. There were 6 crew and 166 passengers on board. The airport was closed for over 24 hours as a result of the accident. Two crew and eight passengers were taken to hospital with minor injuries. As well as damage to the engines and undercarriage, the rear fuselage was also damaged by contact with the runway.
Question:
Ciampino Airport serves which European city?
Answer:
Capital city of italy

Vikramshila Setu
Vikramshila Setu is a bridge across the Ganges, near Bhagalpur in the Indian state of Bihar named after the ancient Mahavihara of Vikramashila which was established by King Dharmapala (783 to 820 A.D.) .

Vikramshila Setu is 3rd longest bridge over water in India. The 4.7 km long  two lane bridge serves as a link between NH 80 and NH 31 running on the opposite sides of the Ganges. It runs from Barari Ghat on the Bhagalpur side on the south bank of the Ganges to Naugachia on the north bank. It also connects Bhagalpur to Purnia and Kathiar.  This has reduced considerably the road travel distance between Bhagalpur and places across the Ganges.  However, there is intense traffic congestion on the bridge due to increased traffic and there is now a demand to construct another bridge parallel to it.
Question:
What literally connects Vikramshila Setu, Rajendra Setu, Mahatma Gandhi Setu and Farakka Barrage?
