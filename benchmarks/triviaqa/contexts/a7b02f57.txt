Passage:
Margaux
Margaux is a  commune in the Gironde department in Aquitaine in southwestern France.

Geography

The village lies in the Haut Médoc wine making region on the left bank of the Garonne estuary, northwest of the city of Bordeaux.

Population

Wines

Margaux is the name of the wine appellation d'origine, Margaux AOC, that encompasses the village and the neighbouring villages of Arsac, Labarde, Soussans and Cantenac, and is the most southerly of Médoc's appellations. The commune makes almost entirely red wine.

The 1855 classification contained more wines from Margaux than from any other appellation, and its best-known vineyard, Château Margaux, was one of only four wines to be awarded the Premier Cru status.

Cultural references

The singer-songwriter and oenologist Al Stewart released an album of songs involving wine in 2000 called Down in the Cellar, of which one track is entitled "Waiting for Margaux."

In the movie Withnail & I, the character Uncle Monty brings a bottle of '53 Margaux ("best of the century") to the cottage in the country.

In the 2009 movie Sherlock Holmes, Holmes (Robert Downey_Jr) refers to a Margaux 1858 and expresses fascination that an astronomical event can affect the quality of the harvest, referring to the 1858 Margaux being a comet vintage.

Passage:
The Capital of Alaska is Not Accessible By Car
The Capital of Alaska is Not Accessible By Car
Date of Admission to the Union- January 3, 1959
Slogan- “North to the Future”
State website URL- www.alaska.gov
Alaska is the largest state as far as land mass goes, but remains sparsely populated and remote. One might say that Juneau is the most distinct capital city in the U.S due to its relative remoteness. Residents from the rest of the state cannot just drive to Juneau; they must take a plane or a ferry. Geographically not only is Alaska one of the most wild and remote of the 50 states, it harbors what is believed to be the last, large storehouse of petroleum, much of it lying beneath government protected land—National and State parks. While every other state cuts itself into counties, Alaska is measured out in boroughs, a vestige of densely populated regions where municipalities are not so multi-layered.
Plenty of northern tier states win awards for extremes of hot and cold, but none can hold a candle to the northern area of Alaska, whose climate is not too dissimilar from that of the North Pole or Arctic Circle. Most people perhaps don’t realize that Alaska was originally a Russian possession. Alaska sits only a short distance across the Bering Sea from the shores of extreme eastern Russia.
Perhaps it is these extremes of climate that make it an unlikely place to grow your own food. Seafood is cheap and the foodstuff of choice in many remote towns. Game meat falls outside the typical Angus beef and consists of moose and reindeer. Thanks to the icy temperatures the world-renowned World Ice Art Championships are held annually and sled dog racing is a popular sport. Birding enthusiasts flock to Alaska’s Stikine River each spring to witness the growing population of bald eagles.
Socially speaking Alaska suffers from some of the same maladies as do Native Americans in the contiguous states, only more elevated: alcoholism is so much an issue that many communities are dry, yet in contrast, possession of small amounts of marijuana is perfectly legal. In an effort to build a thriving social structure and boost the state’s economy the University of Alaska provides attractive scholarships to the state’s brightest high school graduates.
Question:
Which US state capital is only accessible by sea and air?

City and Borough of Juneau, Alaska
Passage:
Luke Duke
Lucas K. "Luke" Duke was born on November 6th 1951, Luke is a fictional character in the American television series The Dukes of Hazzard which ran from 1979 to 1985. Luke was played by Tom Wopat. 

Luke, and his younger cousin Bo Duke live in an unincorporated area of the fictional Hazzard County, in Georgia. Luke and Bo own a 1969 Dodge Charger, nicknamed The General Lee, which is painted orange, with the Confederate Flag on top, and 01 painted on the sides. Luke and Bo evade the corrupt politicians of Hazzard County, such as Boss Hogg and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane along with his deputy(s).

The Duke family, including cousin Daisy Duke and Uncle Jesse Duke, is well known for their role in the moonshine business among other interests. Bo and Luke had both been sentenced to probation for illegal transportation of moonshine. As a result, neither was permitted to use firearms, instead preferring to use bow and arrows. It should also be noted that the terms of Bo and Luke's probation included staying within the boundaries of Hazzard County (unless given special permission by their Probation Officer, who happened to be Boss Hogg).

Of the two Duke boys, Luke was considered to be the more intelligent, "cool-headed" one. Where Bo was the one known to get the two into trouble, Luke was the one who usually got them out of it. Luke was older, and more mature than his younger cousin Bo. He usually thought his way through situations that arose, in contrast to Bo, whose actions were much more precarious. In one episode, Bo mentions that Luke had served in the U.S. Marine corps. His service in the Marines is confirmed in the episode titled "Mason Dixon Girls" where Luke explains he learned to hang glide in the Marines, in season two's "Follow that Still" where Luke mentions that he drove an APC in the Marines, and also in "Sittn' Dukes" where two convicts break out of prison and head to the nearby Dukes farm because one remembers Luke as his sergeant from the marines who busted him and as payback forces the Dukes to help them escape across the state line. However, when it came to fisticuffs, Luke was by far the more skilled fighter of the two, and was an amateur boxer in the Corps. Luke was also the more physical one, often performing stunts like jumping onto moving cars during high speed chases and rescuing Bo from sticky situations. 

Luke's famous "hood slide" (as seen in the opening credits, originating from the second episode, "Daisy's Song") is the trick most commonly associated with the character. In a subsequent TV interview, Tom Wopat admitted that the move was actually a mistake; it originated when he was trying to vault over the car to get to the passenger side and his foot accidentally caught the edge of the hood, causing his leg to slide across it. They actually reshot it without the stumble, but for some unknown reason the show aired the slide with the stumble. The move eventually caught on and became the character's hallmark. Additionally, in this initial slide, Wopat caught his hand on the hood radio aerial, leading to the aerial being removed from all later examples of the car to avoid risk of injury. 

Despite being quite a skilled driver, Luke rarely ever drove The General Lee; he usually preferred to ride shotgun because the General Lee had too much horsepower, which was why Bo drove the General Lee in almost every episode---however, Bo was also an ex-stockcar driver, so he was used to driving cars with a lot of horsepower.

In the pilot episode of the series, Bo commented (possibly just as a joke) that Luke's probably the father of at least two of the children who live at the Hazzard County Orphanage.

Luke later left Hazzard County, along with his cousin Bo, to join the NASCAR circuit  which means they got a long probation permission from Boss Hogg for a while (they both returned the following year). His cousin Vance replaced him during that time.

According to the 1997 Reunion movie, Luke eventually would leave Hazzard for good, and put his military training to good use by becoming a fire jumper for the U.S. Forest Service. During training in Montana, he met and fell in love with a woman named Anita Blackwell, who was a talented singer. He convinced her to leave to pursue her dreams, and she became a successful country music star. Luke met her again in the 2000 Hazzard in Hollywood movie, although by then she was married to another man.

Luke Duke was later played by Johnny Knoxville in the subsequent cinematic version and Randy Wayne in the direct-to-DVD prequel, The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning.

Bislett Games
The Bislett Games is an annual track and field meeting at the Bislett Stadium in Oslo, Norway. Previously one of the IAAF Golden League events, it is now part of the IAAF Diamond League. It is sponsored by ExxonMobil and officially known as the ExxonMobil Bislett Games.

History

The first international athletics meeting at Bislett was held in 1924. Until 1937 the competitions are known as "The American Meetings". Different organizers staged the meetings between 1947 and 1965 until the three athletics associations BUL, Vidar and Tjalve formed the Bislett Alliance. At this year Arne Haukvik founded the Bislett Games. He was a former politician and director of the meeting, who used to invite the athletes, sponsors and the press to his home for his traditional "strawberry party" the day before the event each year. He died of cancer in 2002 at age 76. The tradition however is continued.

Bislett Stadium was used for speed skating events at the Olympics, but nowadays it is better known for its Bislett Games athletics meeting. Bislett Games attract the best track and field athletes from all over the world, and 65 world records have been set on its forgiving, brick-coloured track so far. Due to the building of the new Bislett Stadium in Oslo, which started in April 2004, the 2004 edition of the traditional athletics meeting was staged on Fana stadion in Bergen under the name Bergen Bislett Games.

In 2009, a severe storm delayed proceedings and even caused damage to the track-side clock display. Sanya Richards recorded the fastest women's 400 metres time since 2006 while the Dream Mile brought a number of records with winner Deresse Mekonnen improving upon his Ethiopian record, Kenyan William Biwott Tanui setting a world junior record and third-placed Augustine Choge beating his personal best. Former javelin winners Andreas Thorkildsen and Tero Pitkämäki continued their five-year shared dominance of the Bislett Games, with Pitkämäki taking the victory this time. 

World records

Over the course of its history, numerous world records have been set at the Games and former athletics meetings at Bislett stadium.

Passage:
Scoville scale
The Scoville scale is a measurement of the pungency (spicy heat) of chili peppers, such as the jalapeño, the bhut jolokia, and the world's current hottest pepper—the Carolina Reaper, or other spicy foods as reported in Scoville heat units (SHU),  a function of capsaicin concentration. Capsaicin is one of many related chemicals, collectively called capsaicinoids.
The scale is named after its creator, American pharmacist Wilbur Scoville. His method, devised in 1912, is known as the Scoville Organoleptic Test.

Unlike methods based on high-performance liquid chromatography, the Scoville scale is an empirical measurement dependent on the capsaicin sensitivity of testers and so is not a precise or accurate method to measure capsaicinoid concentration.

Scoville organoleptic test 

In Scoville's method, an exact weight of dried pepper is dissolved in alcohol to extract the heat components (capsinoids), then diluted in a solution of sugar water.  Decreasing concentrations of the extracted capsinoids are given to a panel of five trained tasters, until a majority (at least three) can no longer detect the heat in a dilution. The heat level is based on this dilution, rated in multiples of 100 SHU.

A weakness of the Scoville Organoleptic Test is its imprecision due to human subjectivity, depending on the taster's palate and their number of mouth heat receptors, which varies greatly among people. Another weakness is sensory fatigue: the palate is quickly desensitised to capsaicins after tasting a few samples within a short time period. Results vary widely (up to ± 50%) between laboratories. 

Scoville ratings

Considerations

Since Scoville ratings are defined per unit of dry mass, comparison of ratings between products having different water content can be misleading.
For example, typical fresh chili peppers have a water content around 90 percent, whereas Tabasco sauce has a water content of 95 percent.  For law-enforcement-grade pepper spray, values from 500,000 up to 1 million SHU have been mentioned,  but the actual strength of the spray depends on the dilution, which could vary by a factor of 10. 

The chilis with the highest rating on the Scoville scale exceed one million Scoville units, and include specimens of naga jolokia or bhut jolokia and its cultivar, the "ghost chili", which does not have official cultivar status.  The Carolina Reaper is currently the highest rated pepper in the world. 

Numerical results for any specimen vary depending on its cultivation conditions and the uncertainty of the laboratory methods used to assess the capsaicinoid content. Pungency values for any pepper are variable, owing to expected variation within a species—easily by a factor of 10 or more—depending on seed lineage, climate (humidity is a big factor for the Bhut Jolokia; the Dorset Naga and the original Naga have quite different ratings), and even soil (this is especially true of habaneros). The inaccuracies described in the measurement methods above also contribute to the imprecision of these values.

Peppers

Pure chemicals

ASTA pungency units

Since at least the 1980s, spice heat has been more precisely measured by a method that uses high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This identifies and measures the concentration of heat-producing chemicals. The measurements are used in a mathematical formula that weights them according to their relative capacity to produce a sensation of heat. This method yields results, not in Scoville units, but in American Spice Trade Association (ASTA) pungency units. A measurement of one part capsaicin per million corresponds to about 16 Scoville units, and the published method says that ASTA pungency units can be multiplied by 16 and reported as Scoville units. Scoville units are a measure for capsaicin content per unit of dry mass.    This conversion is approximate, and spice experts Donna R. Tainter and Anthony T. Grenis say that there is consensus that it gives results about 20–50% lower than the actual Scoville method would have given.

Pharmaceutical use 

Neuropathy symptoms are often treated with high concentrations of topical hot pepper extracts (capsaicin) that is applied to the skin. This treatment can last as long as twelve weeks. Initially, the treatment is uncomfortable and a local anesthesia can be used to relieve the pain.

At the time of her life, there was a revival of evangelical Christianity. Emily Dickinson was rare in refusing to profess a Christian faith whilst at Amherst College. Her religious views were not easy to pigeonhole.
Her father served for a time in the House of Representatives.
By her late twenties, she rarely ventured out of the house, preferring seclusion to write at home. Emily was often referred to as the “Myth of Amherst” and later the “Nun of Amherst.” After her death and subsequent fame, she became the “Belle of Amherst.
Emily Dickinson died at the age of 55 from Bight’s disease, which is caused by kidney degeneration.
During her lifetime, only seven of her poems were published to a small circulation. This included publication in Samuel Bowles’ Springfield Republican between 1858 and 1868. They were heavily edited from Emily’s originals.
After her death, her sister found 1,000 poems in Emily’s bureau. She had them edited and published in three series. In 1955, a total of 1,800 poems were published.
Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality, two recurring topics in letters to her friends.

Passage:
Antonia de Sancha
Antonia de Sancha (born 14 September 1961 in Hammersmith, London) is an English actress and businesswoman best known as the former mistress of British Conservative Member of Parliament and Cabinet minister David Mellor which became public knowledge in 1992.  

She is the daughter of a Spanish film producer father, who died in the mid-1980s,  and a Swedish mother who, suffering from severe depression, committed suicide 18 months later, shortly before her daughter began studies at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. At the time of the revelations of her affair, de Sancha was described by some news outlets as a "soft-porn actress" because she had played the part of a prostitute in a film in which she had simulated sex. The film "The Pieman" also featured John Hemming-Clark,  leader of political party Independents to Save Queen Mary's Hospital, as de Sancha's husband. Although "The Pieman" has never been on general release, an account of the plot can be found in Hemming-Clark's book, In You Go! A year or two in the life of a scout leader.  The affair with Mellor was a contributory factor in his subsequent resignation from the cabinet on 24 September 1992. 

Believing her acting career was ruined and aware that newspapers were making money out of the story and she wasn't, de Sancha hired publicist Max Clifford to sell her story to various newspapers. She made about £30,000 from those sales.

The furore that followed publication left her deeply unhappy. "It was emotional rape", de Sancha told an interviewer ten years after the scandal referring to the bugging of her flat which led to the affair being made public. She has had scarcely any work as an actress since the scandal, and considers the scandal as the reason a subsequent marriage failed.

She was the subject of an instalment of the Discovery Channel documentary series The Mistress in 2002. De Sancha now runs an Indian textiles importing business in Portobello Road, Kensington, west London.

Passage:
Geraldine Granger
Boadicea Geraldine Kennedy (née Granger) is a fictional female vicar, the central character to the successful British BBC sitcom The Vicar of Dibley. She is portrayed by Dawn French, described by the British Comedy Guide as "the jolly, down-to-earth female vicar of Dibley, a small country village inhabited by oddballs. After overcoming the town's initial shock at her gender Geraldine helps to improve the village." 
Much of the source of comedy comes from the way French plays the female vicar with her extroverted and fun-loving nature,  frequent colourful language, and behaviour as a vicar which would usually be frowned on by the church.

The character made a debut in 1994,  and on 15 March 2013, French reprised her role as  Granger as part of her French and Saunders marathon on BBC Radio 2.

Character

Granger arrived at the parish church to a shocked congregation, leading her to remark: "You were expecting a bloke - beard, bible, bad breath. And instead, you got a babe with a bob cut and a magnificent bosom."  She is a bonne vivante and a liberal woman who enjoys nothing more than a good laugh, much to the consternation of her love interest David Horton. Despite her fun-loving and sometimes outrageous behaviour, she is deeply caring and does her best to help those in her parish in any way she can. She is well aware of her obesity but seems to take a relatively laid-back attitude toward it. A self-confessed chocoholic, her favourite being Smarties and Curly Wurlys, she often will go on a diet only to break it within minutes by eating one of the innumerable chocolate bars that she has hidden throughout her house (even in hollowed-out Bibles). On one occasion, she gives up chocolate for Lent and nearly goes mad but does succeed. She has an enormous crush on actor Sean Bean.

Despite her kind-hearted nature, Geraldine is not above occasional arrogance. In the second season episode "Celebrity Vicar", after a spot on local radio led to several high-profile media appearances, Geraldine allowed fame to go to her head, and became overconfident and self-absorbed, caring more about her public image and TV career than she did about her parishioners or her duties as a priest. She was later humbled after the tabloids printed several offensive articles about the members of the village council, and she struggled to regain their trust.

Her unusual first name Boadicea is revealed later in the series, much to David Horton's ongoing amusement, although in the final episode her full name is given as Geraldine Julie Andrews Dick van Dyke Supercalifragilisticexpialidocius Chim-Chiminey Chim-Chiminey Chim-Chim-Cheree Granger, the latter due to her mother's favourite book being Mary Poppins and the fact that the film was released the year of Geraldine's birth.

Her best friend is Alice Tinker (Emma Chambers);  at the end of each episode she tells a joke to Alice, but Alice rarely understands the humour. Geraldine was once going to marry David Horton but decided not to after all. In 2006, she receives a proposal from accountant Harry Jasper Kennedy and accepts by running around the village, screaming. In the final episode she marries him in a bizarre wedding with touches of Doctor Who, including the two bridesmaids being dressed as Daleks and with parts of the church decorated with vegetables. She ends up getting married in her pyjamas because her wedding dress has been accidentally covered with mud by Owen Newitt.

David Walliams relieved after 140-mile Thames charity swim
13 September 2011
Close share panel
Media captionSpeaking after the end of his epic swim, Walliams said he was "relieved" and "overwhelmed"
David Walliams said he felt relieved after completing a 140-mile swim along the length of the River Thames.
He reached Westminster Bridge eight days after starting near the river's source, during which he battled illness and rescued a dog.
By the time he finished Walliams had raised more than £1m for the Big Splash Challenge for Sport Relief .
After his swim, Walliams told the BBC: "A bath is the only water I want to see for quite a while."
The comedian had already completed swims across the English Channel in 2006 and the Strait of Gibraltar in 2008 in previous charity events.
The Little Britain star entered the water at Teddington Lock on Monday morning, completing a further 15 miles to reach his goal.
The last leg of his challenge saw him tackle the tidal stretch of the Thames, with strong currents and undertows, along with busy river traffic.
'Thames tummy'
Walliams was greeted on Westminster Bridge by his wife Lara Stone who has been following his progress in a support boat.
Fellow comedians Lenny Henry and Miranda Hart and Olympic rower Steve Redgrave were among the huge crowd cheering him on.
Image caption David Walliams has raised more than £1m for Big Splash Challenge for Sport Relief
As he clambered out of the water just before 18:30 BST towards a podium at County Hall on the southern bank of the Thames, there was a shower of red, white and blue ticker tape.
He said as he crossed the finish, there was a wave of "relief that I didn't have to do any more".
He began near Lechlade, in Gloucestershire, on 5 September but soon suffered a bout of "Thames tummy" which left him with a high temperature.
"It was hard work," Walliams told BBC News.
"It was really, really tough and the distance took it out of me. I did a lot of training but I don't know quite how you can prepare for this because it's an endurance event."
He said it was "beautiful" coming into London and seeing the Houses of Parliament in the sun.
"I felt really proud to be British and really proud that all the people cared," he said.
Organisers of the BT Sport Relief Challenge said Walliams's swim had raised £1,093,325 by the time he finished, with more continuing to come in.

Achy Breaky Heart
"Achy Breaky Heart" is a country song written by Don Von Tress. Originally titled "Don't Tell My Heart" and performed by The Marcy Brothers in 1991, its name was later changed to "Achy Breaky Heart" and performed by Billy Ray Cyrus on his 1992 album Some Gave All. As Cyrus' debut single and signature song, it made him famous and has been his most successful song. It became the first single ever to achieve triple Platinum status in Australia and the 1992's best-selling single in the same country.  In the United States it became a crossover hit on pop and country radio, peaking at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topping the Hot Country Songs chart, becoming the first country single to be certified Platinum since Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton's "Islands in the Stream" in 1983.  The single topped in several countries and after being featured on Top of the Pops in the United Kingdom, peaked at number 3 on the UK Singles Chart. It remains Cyrus's biggest hit single in the U.S. to date, and his only one to reach the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. Thanks to the video of this hit, there was the explosion of the line dance into the mainstream, becoming a craze.     The song is considered by some as one of the worst songs of all time, featuring at number two in VH1 and Blender list of the "50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs Ever." 

Background

The song was initially to be recorded by The Oak Ridge Boys in the early 1990s but the group decided against recording it after lead singer Duane Allen said that he did not like the words "achy breaky".  It was then recorded in 1991 under the title "Don't Tell My Heart" by The Marcy Brothers and Billy Ray Cyrus on his debut album Some Gave All in 1992.  It is written in the key of A major and possesses only two chords: A and E.

The music video for the song was filmed during a concert at the Paramount Arts Center in Ashland, KY. It was nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year in the 35th Annual Grammy Awards in 1993, but lost both awards to Eric Clapton's "Tears in Heaven."

Other cover versions

*Alvin and the Chipmunks covered the song in 1992 on Chipmunks in Low Places. This version, which features speaking parts by Billy Ray himself, reached number 71 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, becoming their first chart entry on any Billboard chart in 32 years.
*Kikki Danielsson covered the song with lyrics in Swedish by Mikael Wendt and Christer Lundh, as "En allra sista chans" on her 1993 album Jag ska aldrig lämna dig. 

Parodies

In the Hannah Montana episode "The Way We Almost Weren't", Billy Ray Cyrus' character Robby Stewart is seen in a fictional setting writing "Achy Breaky Heart" in a New Mexico cafe in 1987. He tries the words "itchy twitchy heart" and "herky jerky heart" but is unsatisfied. Jackson suggests he use the words "achy breaky," but Robby blows it off as "the dumbest thing I've ever heard." 

Celtic fans used the tune of the song to pay tribute to winger Paddy McCourt, a trend continued by various teams, for instance Newcastle United fans for midfielder Yohan Cabaye,West Ham United fans towards attacking midfielder Dimitri Payet  and Leicester City fans for winger Anthony Knockaert.

Critical reception

The song reached number 23 on CMT's 100 Greatest Videos in 2008, and number 2 on Blender magazine's 50 Worst Songs Ever. In 2002, Shelly Fabian from About.com ranked the song number 249 on the list of the Top 500 Country Music Songs. In 2007, the song was ranked at number 87 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s.

Passage:
Dunnock
The dunnock (Prunella modularis) is a small passerine, or perching bird, found throughout temperate Europe and into Asia. Dunnocks have also been successfully introduced into New Zealand. It is by far the most widespread member of the accentor family, which otherwise consists of mountain species. Other common names of the dunnock include the hedge accentor, hedge sparrow, or hedge warbler. The name "dunnock" comes from the Ancient British *dunnākos, meaning "little brown one."  However, common or garden English dun (dingy brown, dark-colored) and the diminutive ock would also produce dunnock. Cf. pillock.

Description

A European robin-sized bird, the dunnock typically measures 13.5–14 cm in length. It possesses a streaked back, somewhat resembling a small house sparrow. Like that species, the dunnock has a drab appearance in order to avoid predation. It is brownish underneath, and has a fine pointed bill. Adults have a grey head, and both sexes are similarly coloured.

Distribution and habitat

Dunnocks reside in the more mild western and southern parts of the globe, inhabiting much of Europe including Lebanon, northern Iran, and the Caucasus. Dunnocks were successfully introduced into New Zealand during the 19th century, and are now widely distributed around the country and some offshore islands.   Favourite habitats include woodlands, shrubs, gardens, and hedgerows.

Territoriality

 

The main call of the dunnock is a shrill, persistent tseep along with a high trilling note, which betrays the bird's otherwise inconspicuous presence. The song is rapid, thin and tinkling, a sweet warble which can be confused with that of the Eurasian wren, but is shorter and weaker.

Dunnocks are territorial and may engage in conflict with other birds that encroach upon their nests. Males sometimes share a territory and exhibit a strict dominance hierarchy. Nevertheless, this social dominance is not translated into benefits to the alpha male in terms of reproduction, since parternity is usually equally shared between males of the group.   Furthermore, members of a group are rarely related, and so competition can result. 

Female territorial ranges are almost always exclusive. However, sometimes, multiple males will cooperate to defend a single territory containing multiple females. Males exhibit a strong dominance hierarchy within groups: older birds tend to be the alpha males and first-year birds are usually the betas. Studies have found that close male relatives almost never share a territory.

The male’s ability to access females generally depends on female range size, which is affected by the distribution of food. When resources are distributed in dense patches, female ranges tend to be small and easy for males to monopolize. Subsequent mating systems, as discussed below, reflect high reproductive success for males and relatively lower success for females. In times of scarcity, female territories expand to accommodate the lack of resources, causing males to have a more difficult time monopolizing females. Hence, females gain a reproductive advantage over males in this case. 

Breeding

Mating systems

The dunnock possesses variable mating systems. Females are often polyandrous, breeding with two or more males at once,   which is quite rare among birds. This multiple mating system leads to the development of sperm competition amongst the male suitors. DNA fingerprinting has shown that chicks within a brood often have different fathers, depending on the success of the males at monopolising the female.  Males try to ensure their paternity by pecking at the cloaca of the female to stimulate ejection of rival males' sperm.  Dunnocks take just one-tenth of a second to copulate and can mate more than 100 times a day.  Males provide parental care in proportion to their mating success, so two males and a female can commonly be seen provisioning nestlings at one nest.

Other mating systems also exist within dunnock populations, depending on the ratio of male to females and the overlap of territories. When only one female and one male territory overlap, monogamy is preferred. Sometimes, two or three adjacent female territories overlap one male territory, and so polygyny is favored, with the male monopolising several females.  Polygynandry also exists, in which two males jointly defend a territory containing several females.  Polyandry, though, is the most common mating system of dunnocks found in nature.  Depending on the population, males generally have the best reproductive success in polygynous populations, while females have the advantage during polyandry.

Studies have illustrated the fluidity of dunnock mating systems. When given food in abundance, female territory size is reduced drastically. Consequently, males can more easily monopolise the females. Thus, the mating system can be shifted from one that favours female success (polyandry), to one that promotes male success (monogamy, polygynandry, or polygyny). 

Nest

The dunnock builds a neat nest (predominantly from twigs and moss and lined with soft materials such as wool or feathers), low in a bush or conifer, where adults typically lay three to five unspotted blue eggs.

Parental care and provisioning

Broods, depending on the population, can be raised by a lone female, multiple females with the part-time help of a male, multiple females with full-time help by a male, or by multiple females and multiple males. In pairs, the male and the female invest parental care at similar rates. However, in trios, the female and alpha male invest more care in chicks than does the beta male. In territories in which females are able to escape from males, both the alpha and beta males share provisioning equally. This last system represents the best case scenario for females, as it helps to ensure maximal care and the success of the young.

A study has found that males tend to not discriminate between their own young and those of another male in polyandrous or polygynandrous systems. However, they do vary their feeding depending on the certainty of paternity. If a male has greater access to a female, and therefore a higher chance of a successful fertilisation, during a specific mating period, it would provide more care towards the young.

Passage:
Galapagos penguin
The Galápagos penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus) is a penguin endemic to the Galápagos Islands. It is the only penguin that lives north of the equator in the wild. It can survive due to the cool temperatures resulting from the Humboldt Current and cool waters from great depths brought up by the Cromwell Current. The Galápagos penguin is one of the banded penguins, the other species of which live mostly on the coasts of Africa and mainland South America.

Description

The average Galápagos penguin is 49 cm long and  in weight. It is the second smallest species of penguin after the little penguin. Galápagos penguins have a black head with a white border running from behind the eye, around the black ear-coverts and chin, to join on the throat. They have black-grey upperparts and whitish underparts, with two black bands across the breast, the lower band extending down the flanks to the thigh. Juveniles differ in having a wholly dark head, greyer on side and chin, and no breast-band. The female penguins are smaller than the males.

Distribution 

The Galápagos penguin is found primarily on Fernandina Island and the west coast of Isabela Island, but small populations are scattered on other islands in the Galápagos archipelago.

While ninety percent of the Galápagos penguins live among the western islands of Fernandina and Isabela, they also occur on Santiago, Bartolomé, northern Santa Cruz, and Floreana. The northern tip of Isabela crosses the equator, meaning that some Galápagos penguins live the northern hemisphere, the only penguins to do so.

Ecology and behavior

The penguins stay in the archipelago. They stay by the Cromwell Current during the day since it is cooler and return to the land at night. They eat small schooling fish, mainly mullet, sardines, and sometimes crustaceans. They search for food only during the day and normally within a few kilometers of their breeding site. They depend on the cold nutrient-rich currents to bring them food.

The temperature on the Galapagos Islands stays between 15 and 28 °C (59–82 °F). During El Niño seasons, the penguins put off breeding, because their food becomes less abundant; this makes the chances of raising offspring successfully unfavorable compared to the chances of dying in the attempt. They usually breed when the sea surface temperature is below 24 °C (75 °F) which results in more food for them. The strong sun is the main problem for the penguins. Their primary means of cooling off is going into the water, but they have other behavioral adaptations because of all the time they spend on land. They use two methods of thermoregulation in warmer weather on land. One is by stretching out their flippers and hunching forward to keep the sun from shining on their feet, since they can lose heat from their flippers due to the blood flow there. They also pant, using evaporation to cool the throat and airways. Galápagos penguins protect their eggs and chicks from the hot sun by keeping them in deep crevices in the rocks.

The species is endangered, with an estimated population size of around 1,500 individuals in 2004, according to a survey by the Charles Darwin Research Station. The population underwent an alarming decline of over 70% in the 1980s, but is slowly recovering. It is therefore the rarest penguin species (a status which is often falsely attributed to the yellow-eyed penguin). Population levels are influenced by the effects of the El Niño Southern Oscillation, which reduces the availability of shoaling fish, leading to low reproduction or starvation. However, anthropogenic factors (e.g. oil pollution, fishing by-catch and competition) may be adding to the ongoing demise of this species. On Isabela Island, introduced cats, dogs, and rats attack penguins and destroy their nests. When in the water, they are preyed upon by sharks, fur seals, and sea lions.

Breeding

There are fewer than 1000 breeding pairs of Galápagos penguins in the world.   Most nests are seen between May and January. The nests are made within 50 m of the water on the shore, usually on Fernandina and Isabela Islands. Adults stay near the breeding area during the year with their mate. When the penguins are breeding, incubation takes 38–40 days with both parents helping out. The Galápagos penguin mates for life. It lays one or two eggs in places such as caves and crevices, protected from direct sunlight, which can lead to the eggs overheating. One parent will always stay with the eggs or chicks while the other is absent for several days to feed. The parents usually rear only one child. If there is not enough food available, the nest may be abandoned. Thirty days after the chicks hatch, the chicks' feathers are brown above and white below. These feathers are to protect the chicks from the strong sun rather than keep them warm. Bermudian naturalist Louis L. Mowbray was the first to successfully breed the Galápagos penguins in captivity. 

Predators

Because of the Galápagos penguin's smaller size, it has many predators. On land, the penguins are preyed upon by crabs, snakes, rice rats, cats, hawks, and owls. While in the water they are preyed upon by sharks, fur seals, and sea lions.  They face many hazards due to humans, as well as the hazards of unreliable food resources and volcanic activity.  Illegal fishermen may interrupt the penguins’ nesting, and they are often caught in fishing nets by mistake.

Edge (geometry)
For edge in graph theory, see Edge (graph theory)
In geometry, an edge is a particular type of line segment joining two vertices in a polygon, polyhedron, or higher-dimensional polytope.  In a polygon, an edge is a line segment on the boundary,  and is often called a side. In a polyhedron or more generally a polytope, an edge is a line segment where two faces meet.  A segment joining two vertices while passing through the interior or exterior is not an edge but instead is called a diagonal.

Relation to edges in graphs

In graph theory, an edge is an abstract object connecting two graph vertices, unlike polygon and polyhedron edges which have a concrete geometric representation as a line segment.
However, any polyhedron can be represented by its skeleton or edge-skeleton, a graph whose vertices are the geometric vertices of the polyhedron and whose edges correspond to the geometric edges.  Conversely, the graphs that are skeletons of three-dimensional polyhedra can be characterized by Steinitz's theorem as being exactly the 3-vertex-connected planar graphs. 

Number of edges in a polyhedron

Any convex polyhedron's surface has Euler characteristic

V - E + F = 2,

where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces. This equation is known as Euler's polyhedron formula. Thus the number of edges is 2 less than the sum of the numbers of vertices and faces. For example, a cube has 8 vertices and 6 faces, and hence 12 edges.

Incidences with other faces

In a polygon, two edges meet at each vertex; more generally, by Balinski's theorem, at least d edges meet at every vertex of a d-dimensional convex polytope. 
Similarly, in a polyhedron, exactly two two-dimensional faces meet at every edge,  while in higher dimensional polytopes three or more two-dimensional faces meet at every edge.

Alternative terminology

In the theory of high-dimensional convex polytopes, a facet or side of a d-dimensional polytope is one of its (d − 1)-dimensional features, a ridge is a (d − 2)-dimensional feature, and a peak is a (d − 3)-dimensional feature. Thus, the edges of a polygon are its facets, the edges of a 3-dimensional convex polyhedron are its ridges, and the edges of a 4-dimensional polytope are its peaks..
Question:
How many edges does a cube have?
Answer:
twelve
Passage:
Pack animal
A pack animal or beast of burden is an individual or type of working animal used by humans as means of transporting materials by attaching them so their weight bears on the animal's back, in contrast to draft animals which pull loads but do not carry them.

Traditional pack animals are diverse, including camels, goats, yaks, reindeer, water buffalo, and llamas, as well as the more familiar horses, donkeys and mules. 

Pack versus draft

The term pack animal is traditionally used in contrast to draft animal, which is a working animal that typically pulls a load behind itself (such as a plow, a cart, a sled or a heavy log) rather than carrying cargo directly on its back.  For instance, sled dogs pull loads but do not normally carry them, while working elephants have been used for centuries to haul logs out of forests. 

Diversity

Traditional pack animals include ungulates such as camels,  the yak, reindeer, goats,  water buffalo and llama,  and domesticated members of the horse family including horses, donkeys and mules.  Occasionally, dogs can be used to carry small loads.

Uses

Hauling of goods in wagons with horses and oxen gradually displaced the use of packhorses, which had been important until the Middle Ages, by the sixteenth century. 

Pack animals may be fitted with pack saddles and may also carry saddlebags. 

While traditional usage of pack animals by nomadic tribespeople is declining, a new market is growing in the tourist expeditions industry in regions such as the High Atlas mountains of Morocco, allowing visitors the comfort of backpacking with animals.  The use of pack animals "is considered a valid means of viewing and experiencing" some National Parks in America, subject to guidelines and closed areas. 

In the 21st century, special forces have received guidance on the use of horses, mules, llamas, camels, dogs, and elephants as pack animals. 

Load carrying capacity

The maximum load for a camel is roughly 300 kg. 

Yaks are loaded differently according to region. In Sichuan, 75 kg is carried for 30 km in 6 hours. In Qinghai, at 4100 m altitude, packs of up to 300 kg are routinely carried, while up to 390 kg is carried by the heaviest steers for short periods. 

Llamas can carry roughly 1/4 of their body weight, so an adult male of 200 kg can carry some 50 kg. 

Loads for equids are disputed. The US Army specifies a maximum of 20 percent of body weight for mules walking up to 20 miles a day in mountains, giving a load of up to about 150 kg. However an 1867 text mentioned a load of up to 800 pounds (about 360 kg). In India, the prevention of cruelty rules (1965) limit mules to 200 kg and ponies to 70 kg. 

Reindeer can carry up to 40 kg for a prolonged period in mountains.
