Passage:
Victory in Europe Day
Victory in Europe Day, generally known as V-E Day, VE Day or simply V Day was the public holiday celebrated on 8 May 1945 (7 May in Commonwealth realms) to mark the formal acceptance by the Allies of World War II of Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender of its armed forces.  It thus marked the end of World War II in Europe.

The term VE Day existed as early as September 1944,  in anticipation of victory.  On 30 April 1945, Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader, committed suicide during the Battle of Berlin. Germany's surrender, therefore, was authorised by his successor, Reichspräsident Karl Dönitz. The administration headed by Dönitz was known as the Flensburg Government. The act of military surrender was signed on 7 May in Reims, France and on 8 May in Berlin, Germany.

The former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries have historically celebrated the end of World War II on 9 May. However, the Baltic countries now commemorate VE day on 8 May.  In Ukraine from 2015, 8 May was designated as a day of Remembrance and Reconciliation, but it is not a public holiday. 

Celebrations 

Upon the defeat of Germany, celebrations erupted throughout the world. From Moscow to Los Angeles, people celebrated.
In the United Kingdom, more than one million people celebrated in the streets to mark the end of the European part of the war. In London, crowds massed in Trafalgar Square and up the Mall to Buckingham Palace, where King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, appeared on the balcony of the palace before the cheering crowds. Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II) and her sister Princess Margaret were allowed to wander incognito among the crowds and take part in the celebrations. 

In the United States, the victory happened on President Harry Truman's 61st birthday. He dedicated the victory to the memory of his predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had died of a cerebral hemorrhage less than a month earlier, on 12 April.  Flags remained at half-staff for the remainder of the 30-day mourning period.   Truman said of dedicating the victory to Roosevelt's memory and keeping the flags at half-staff that his only wish was "that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived to witness this day." Later that day, Truman said that the victory made it his most enjoyable birthday. 

Massive celebrations also took place in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and especially in New York's Times Square. 

Soviet Victory Day 

As the Soviet representative in Reims had no authority to sign the German instrument of surrender, the Soviet leadership proposed to consider Reims surrender as a "preliminary" act. The surrender ceremony was repeated in Berlin on 8 May, where the instrument of surrender was signed by supreme German military commander Wilhelm Keitel, by Georgy Zhukov and Allied representatives. Since the Soviet Union was to the east of Germany, it was 9 May Moscow time when the German military surrender became effective, which is why Russia and most of the former Soviet republics commemorate Victory Day on 9 May instead of 8 May.

Wizzard Brew
Wizzard Brew is the debut album by glam rock group Wizzard, released in 1973. It reached a peak of No. 29 in the UK Albums Chart.  In the United States, it was released by United Artists Records as Wizzard's Brew (with a different cover photo) but failed to chart there.

In 2003, Mojo magazine ranked it number 18 on its list of the "Top 50 Eccentric Albums". 

History

In approach, the album was much more experimental than the group's hit singles, with elements of hard rock (an approach Wood's previous band The Move had explored on their 1970 album Looking On), and improvisation, especially on the lengthy "Meet Me At The Jailhouse".  Wood frequently used ring modulation to give the instruments a harsh, distorted sound, and the album may represent an early foray into recording technique that would eventually be called lo-fi.  Critical and popular reaction was mixed.

The original release included a lyric and photo sheet. It was reissued on CD in 1999 but soon deleted.  An expanded remastered edition, including the four A-side  and B-sides of the group's singles tracks, was released on CD in November 2006.

Birthstone
A birthstone is a gemstone that represents a person's month of birth. Birth stones are and can be worn as jewellery and pendants.

History of birthstones

Western custom

The first century Jewish historian Josephus believed there was a connection between the twelve stones in Aaron's breastplate, the twelve months of the year, and the twelve signs of the zodiac.  Translations and interpretations of the passage in Exodus regarding the breastplate have varied widely, however, with Josephus himself giving two different lists for the twelve stones  (Kunz argues that Josephus saw the breastplate of the Second Temple, not the one described in Exodus).  St. Jerome, referencing Josephus, said the Foundation Stones of the New Jerusalem (Revelation 21:19–20) would be appropriate for Christians to use.  In the eighth and ninth century, religious treaties associating a particular stone with an apostle were written because the book of Revelation stated "their name would be inscribed on the Foundation Stones, and his virtue".  Practice became to keep twelve stones and wear one a month.  Wearing a single birthstone is only a few centuries old, although modern authorities differ on dates Kunz places the custom in eighteenth century Poland, while the Gemological Institute of America starts it in Germany in the 1560s. 

Modern lists of birthstones have little to do with either the breastplate or the Foundation Stones of Christianity. Tastes, customs and confusing translations have distanced them from their historical origins,  with one author calling the 1912 Kansas list "nothing but a piece of unfounded salesmanship." 

Traditional birthstones

Ancient traditional birthstones are society-based birthstones. The table below contains many stones which are popular choices, often reflecting Polish tradition. 

The Gregorian calendar has poems matching each month with its birthstone. These are traditional stones of English-speaking societies. Tiffany & Co. published these poems "of unknown author" for the first time in a pamphlet in 1870. 

Modern birthstones

In 1912, in an effort to standardize birthstones, the (American) National Association of Jewelers (now called Jewelers of America) met in Kansas and officially adopted a list.  The Jewelry Industry Council of America updated the list in 1952  by adding alexandrite to June and citrine to November; specifying pink tourmaline for October; replacing December's lapis with zircon; and switching the primary/alternative gems in March. The American Gem Trade Association added tanzanite as a December birthstone in 2002.  In 2016, the American Gem Trade Association and Jewelers of America added spinel as an additional birthstone for August.   Britain's National Association of Goldsmiths created their own standardized list of birthstones in 1937. 

Eastern custom

A Hindu text from 1879, Mani Mala, lists gems for each month.

Birthday (day of the week) stones

While this word has also been used as synonym of Birth stone (see above), there is a separate list of assignment according to the day of the week of the recipient's birth:

* Tuesday: ruby, emerald
* Wednesday: amethyst, lodestone

The London Eye is a giant Ferris wheel situated on the banks of the River Thames in London, England. The entire structure is 135 metres (443 ft) tall and the wheel has a diameter of 120 metres (394 ft).
It is the tallest Ferris wheel in Europe, and the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom, visited by over 3.5 million people annually. When erected in 1999 it was the tallest Ferris wheel in the world, until surpassed first by the 160 m (520 ft) Star of Nanchang in 2006 and then the 165 m (541 ft) Singapore Flyer in 2008. It is still described by its operators as "the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel" (as the wheel is supported by an A-frame on one side only, unlike the Nanchang and Singapore wheels). It is the 20th tallest structure in London.
The London Eye, or Millennium Wheel, was officially called the British Airways London Eye and then the Merlin Entertainments London Eye. Since 20 January 2011, its official name is the EDF Energy London Eye following a three-year sponsorship deal.
The London Eye is located in the London Borough of Lambeth at the western end of Jubilee Gardens, on the South Bank of the River Thames between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge.

Abel Janszoon Tasman (1603-1659), by Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp
National Library of Australia, nla.pic-an2282370
Abel Janszoon Tasman (1603?-1659), mariner, was born at Lutjegast, near Groningen, in the Netherlands. He received a sufficient education to enable him to express his ideas clearly in writing and to become a skilled navigator. He married Claesgie Meyndrix, by whom he had a daughter. After his wife died, he married Joanna Tiercx in January 1632. Soon afterwards, as a sailor before the mast, he sailed for the East Indies, where he was a first mate in February and a skipper in May 1634. In that year in a minor exploration he had a narrow escape from death, when in an incautious landing several of his companions were massacred by people of Ceram. After spending some time in warlike and anti-smuggling operations he returned to Holland in 1637.
He sailed for the Indies again in 1638 as skipper of a flute, taking his wife with him. From the outset he was treated as one of the most reliable skippers there. He was at first employed in military and trading voyages, but in 1639 was appointed second-in-command, under Quast, of two ships which set out in June to find islands believed to lie east of Japan. He returned in November from this search. Despite a disastrous death-toll on it, he offered to repeat the search, but was sent instead on trading voyages to Japan and Cambodia.
In 1642 he was appointed to command two ships to explore southern and eastern waters. Sailing in August he discovered Van Diemen's Land, New Zealand, the Tonga Islands and some of the Fiji group, and re-explored part of the north coast of New Guinea. On his return to Batavia in June 1643 he was chosen to take part in an expedition to form a settlement in the Tonga Islands from which the Chilean coast was to be raided; while this expedition was preparing, he was ordered to find whether there was a passage into the South Sea between Carpentaria and De Witt's Land. For this purpose he set out with three vessels at the end of January 1644 and, following the coasts from Cape Valsche round to Cape Cloates, satisfied himself that, except perhaps at Endeavour Strait, there was no passage. He was rewarded after his return in August 1644 by confirmation in the grade of commandeur, with a substantial increase in pay dated back to the beginning of his voyage in 1642.
The plan to raid Chile was abandoned, and Tasman was appointed to the Council of Justice at Batavia. In mid-1647 he was sent on a mission to the King of Siam and was granted precedence over all Dutchmen in the kingdom. After that mission, he was given command of a fleet of eight vessels which sailed in May 1648 against the Spaniards. His conduct in this operation was unsatisfactory and, after his return in January 1649, proceedings were taken against him for having, when inflamed by liquor, treated one of his sailors in a barbarous way; as a result he was removed from office during the governor-general's pleasure. He was formally reinstated in January 1651, but not long afterwards retired from the service and became a merchant in Batavia. He died there in affluent circumstances in 1659. His daughter by his first marriage had married first Philip Heylman, and later Jacob Bremer. In 1661 permission was given for his widow to marry Jan Meyndert Springer.
Tasman was a member of the Reformed Church. He was a brave and energetic mariner, a humane and properly cautious explorer, and a conspicuously able commander, though over-hasty on one occasion at least. Reflections which have been cast upon his courage are the fruit of ignorance. There are two supposed portraits of him: one owned by the Royal Commonwealth Society in London, the other in the National Library in Canberra.

Tower Air
Tower Air was a certificated FAR 121 schedule and charter U.S. airline that operated from 1983 until 2000, when the company declared bankruptcy and was liquidated. Scheduled flights were initially offered over a New York - Brussels - Tel Aviv route in addition to charter flights to Athens, Frankfurt, Rome, and Zurich.  Short-lived New York - Los Angeles flights were introduced with the addition of an ex-Avianca Boeing 747-100 in 1984. The airline was headquartered in Building 178 and later in Hangar 17 at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Jamaica, Queens, New York City.  

History 

Tower Air was co-founded, majority owned, and managed by Morris K. Nachtomi, an Israeli citizen who had emigrated to the United States. After a 30-year career with El Al, Nachtomi joined a wholesaler and tour package operator Tower Travel Corporation in 1981. Tower Travel Corporation was founded by Zev Melamid and his wife Estelle in the 1970s to promote discount travel to Israel. Tower Travel Corporation is credited with developing the wholesale charter market between New York and Tel Aviv.

Tower Air was formed on August 13, 1982 by Zev Melamid, Mordechi Gill, Morris Nachtomi, and Sam Fondlier as equal shareholders.  The airline was formed to replace the lift Tower Travel Corporation lost when Flying Tiger Line via a subsidiary, Metro International Airlines, decided to end scheduled and charter commercial passenger service (although military airlift cargo flights operated by Flying Tiger continued) and the three Boeing 747s configured for passenger flights were traded to Pan Am in exchange for all-cargo 747 freighter aircraft.

Arthur Fondlier, son of Sam Fondlier and the former Chief Financial Officer of Tower Air, was a passenger in first class section of Pan Am flight 103. His untimely death gave Morris Nachtomi much more freedom in management and cost-cutting.

The company won many contracts from the United States Department of Defense to transport armed forces personnel to overseas locations, and from the United Nations to transport troops to their peacekeeping missions all over the world. Tower often flew charters for groups of Muslim pilgrims to Mecca.

Tower Air's main base of scheduled operations was John F. Kennedy International Airport in Jamaica, New York and during their peak they had their own terminal (a former Pan Am Admin facility). There was a large focus on flights to Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv, Israel, becoming a major competitor to El Al and British Airways in the US-Israel market. The airline also had several flights to France, Greece and Brazil, as well as high density domestic destinations in the New York market, including San Juan, Miami, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas, Nevada. Tower Air also sometimes provided substitute aircraft for other carriers, for example on the JFK to LHR route when weather delayed an inbound Virgin Atlantic Airways flight in December 1994.

The 1997 Zagat Survey ranked Tower Air 59th out of 61 ranked carriers in terms of maintenance, ahead of only Valujet and Aeroflot.  In February 1998, the Federal Aviation Administration proposed two civil penalties totaling $276,000 for continuing to fly aircraft that required maintenance.  In January, 1998 the FAA successfully sought to have the airline remove Guy Nachtomi, son of the Chairman and CEO, 24 years old at that time, from the position of Vice President-Operations. This was done in part because of the airline's maintenance problems, as well as his lack of airline experience (he worked at Twentieth Century Fox until 1994).[http://sec.edgar-online.com/1998/05/01/14/0000940180-98-000483/Section9.asp TOWER AIR INC - TOWRQ Proxy Statement (definitive) (DEF 14A) COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS] The junior Mr. Nachtomi continued service with the company in a capacity unrelated to maintenance as Vice President-Office of the Chairman. The Department of Defense Commercial Airlift Review Board suspended Tower Air military charters from January 27 to February 12, 1999, pending an on-site review of its operations. At the same time the airline lost an arbitration brought by the Association of Flight Attendants, claiming that Tower Air was lodging their flight attendants in dirty Tel Aviv hotels with poor security and bed bugs.

Tower Air filed for protection under Chapter 11 bankruptcy on February 29, 2000, ceased all scheduled service on May 1, 2000  and surrendered their FAA  air operator's certificate on November 28, 2000.

Aircraft

Tower Air's fleet consisted of Boeing 747s in both the -100 and -200 series, including both passenger and cargo aircraft.

Incidents and accidents

On December 20, 1995, Tower Air flight 41 from New York Kennedy to Miami veered off the runway during takeoff in a snowstorm resulting in one flight attendant receiving serious injuries and 24 passengers receiving minor injuries. The aircraft sustained heavy damage and had to be written off. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the probable cause of this accident was the captain's failure to reject the takeoff in a timely manner when excessive nosewheel steering tiller inputs resulted in a loss of directional control on a slippery runway.[http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/1996/AAR9604.pdf Runway Departure During Attempted Takeoff, Tower Air Flight 41, Boeing 747-136, N605FF, JFK International Airport, New York, December 20, 1995][http://dnausers.d-n-a.net/dnetGOJG/201295xx.htm NTSB Press Release - 10/29/96]

Muffin the Mule to trot back into the limelight on his urban animal farm
MUFFIN The Mule, the vintage TV puppet, is to make a comeback for his 60th birthday and trot into the twenty-first century.
BBC chiefs have bought a new series based on the character, which is expected to be shown in the next three years. This time round, he will be animated rather than operated with strings and will live on an urban farm.
Muffin was first seen by TV audiences in October 1946 in the show For The Children which was presented by Annette Mills, sister of actor John Mills.
Loading article content
Originally, the wooden puppet - which was made during the 1930s at a cost of 25 shillings ((pounds) 1.25p) - would dance as Mills played the piano, but in the new show he will be seen talking to the other animals. Muffin, it will be recalled, used his head a great deal in ''conversations'' with Ms Mills.
Muffin went from strength to strength, clumping around on the piano top with Ms Mills playing the music and Ann Hogarth standing on the piano to operate him from behind a partition. Further sidekicks emerged as the shows went on, including a bossy penguin called Mr Peregrine Esquire, a rather shy Louise the Lamb, Oswald the Ostrich, Willie the Worm, and a genial minstrel puppet called Wally the Gog.
Muffin was the first star, in Britain at least, entirely created by television.
By 1950, there were many merchandise spin-offs from the character, including records, song and story books and comic strips, while Muffin crossed the Atlantic in films made for American television. Some children even got Muffin bedroom slippers. TV Comic featured Muffin on its front cover for its first issue in November 1951.
A BBC spokeswoman said: ''Muffin will be something of a problem-solver - he helps out all the other animals. The show is being brought up to date and will now be living on a town farm rather than dancing on a piano.''
Rights to the character were bought by production company Maverick Entertainment in January.
Mike Diprose, the firm's managing director, said: ''Muffin the Mule was a hugely successful character in the 1950s and 1960s and is now very much part of English broadcasting heritage.

Just for Laughs
Just for Laughs () is a comedy festival held each July in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Founded in 1983, it is the largest international comedy festival in the world. 

History

Just for Laughs was founded in 1983 by Gilbert Rozon as a two-day French language event. In 1985, Andy Nulman joined the festival's staff and introduced English language events as well; under Nulman's stewardship, the festival increased to a full month, with French-speaking performers during the first half, and English speakers in the second half. International and non-verbal acts (acrobats, pantomimes, etc.) are scattered throughout the program. 

In 1999, Nulman left the festival's full-time employ; however, he directed its major Gala Shows at the Saint-Denis Theatre every July, and remained on the board of directors of the festival's parent company. After an 11-year absence, Nulman returned to Just for Laughs in July 2010 as president of Festivals and Television. 

Each day, performers, "New Vaudevillians" and other acts both vocal and visual perform throughout the city, particularly in the "Latin Quarter"—an area known for its theatres, cafés and boutique shopping. In the evenings, the nightclubs and live venue theatres offer special programs supporting the performers. 

Although Just for Laughs attracts spectators from around the world, many of those in the audience are talent scouts, booking agents, producers and managers from the entertainment industry. Performing at the festival is one of the biggest opportunities for undiscovered talent to showcase their act in front of industry professionals.

The Just for Laughs festival also has the Comedia comedy film festival component, which started in 1996. It gives awards for feature and short films. 2005, Comedia screened 125 short films from around the world as well as several feature-length films.

In February 1994, the festival sponsored a splinter project in Hollywood, Florida. That coastal area is a favourite winter destination for Quebecers who head south to vacation in the warmer weather. The event, Juste Pour Rire—En Vacances (Just For Laughs—On Vacation), was held in the Young Circle Park, an outdoor venue with an urban park setting.

In July 2007, Just For Laughs celebrated its 25th edition, launching a festival in Toronto, Ontario. In 2009, the Chicago festival was launched and aired on TBS.

TV shows

Just for Laughs has also been a launchpad for many US network television and sitcom careers, and is frequently featured as a foreign on-location highlight of late-night US network talk shows.

Just For Laughs films many performances at the annual festival in Montreal and the TV productions from these tapings air regularly on CBC Television, The Comedy Network, TVA and YTV. The shows feature stand-up performances from the festival and sometimes include "canned bits" shot on location around Montreal, Canada.

During the summer of 2007, ABC aired episodes of Just for Laughs: Gags.  It consisted of two half-hour episodes, and aired mostly on Tuesdays from 8:00 pm to 9:00 pm ET. 

The content and format was exactly the same as the Canadian counterpart, but was hosted by Rick Miller, who introduced each segment with a quirky pun. The show returned to the ABC lineup as a mid-season replacement on January 1, 2008.  The series was initially not renewed after the half-season, but ABC reversed their decision. 

The third season of the show, titled simply Just for Laughs, began airing on June 21, 2009 at 7:00 pm ET.   The program returned in the 2014-15 season under the Just for Laughs: Gags title as a syndicated offering to the United States through PPI Releasing, which mainly specializes in syndicating Canadian programming to American stations.

Just for Laughs: All Access, which airs on The Comedy Network, airs recordings of live stand-up comedy performances from the festival.

Pointillism
Pointillism is a technique of painting in which small, distinct dots of color are applied in patterns to form an image. Georges Seurat and Paul Signac developed the technique in 1886, branching from Impressionism.  The term "Pointillism" was first coined by art critics in the late 1880s to ridicule the works of these artists, and is now used without its earlier mocking connotation. The movement Seurat began with this technique is known as Neo-Impressionism. The Divisionists, too, used a similar technique of patterns to form images, though with larger cube-like brushstrokes.

The technique relies on the ability of the eye and mind of the viewer to blend the color spots into a fuller range of tones. It is related to Divisionism, a more technical variant of the method. Divisionism is concerned with color theory, whereas pointillism is more focused on the specific style of brushwork used to apply the paint."Pointillism."  Artcyclopedia. Artists by Movement. John Malyon/Artcyclopedia, 2007. Web. http://www.artcyclopedia.com/history/pointillism.html It is a technique with few serious practitioners today,  and is notably seen in the works of Seurat, Signac and Cross. However, see also Andy Warhol's early works, and Pop Art.

Practice

The practice of Pointillism is in sharp contrast to the traditional methods of blending pigments on a palette. Pointillism is analogous to the four-color CMYK printing process used by some color printers and large presses that place dots of Cyan (blue), Magenta (red), Yellow, and Key (black). Televisions and computer monitors use a similar technique to represent image colors using Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) colors.

If red, blue, and green light (the additive primaries) are mixed, the result is something close to white light (see Prism (optics)). Painting is inherently subtractive, but Pointillist colors often seem brighter than typical mixed subtractive colors. This may be partly because subtractive mixing of the pigments is avoided, and partly because some of the white canvas may be showing between the applied dots.

The painting technique used for Pointillist color mixing is at the expense of the traditional brushwork used to delineate texture.

The majority of Pointillism is done in oil paints. Anything may be used in its place, but oils are preferred for their thickness and tendency not to run or bleed. 

Music

Pointillism also refers to a style of 20th-century music composition. Different musical notes are made in seclusion, rather than in a linear sequence, giving a sound texture similar to the painting version of Pointillism.  This type of music is also known as punctualism or klangfarbenmelodie.

The awards show

Since its inception (created by Rick Garson, Paul Flattery & Jim Yukich), the BMAs had been telecast on the Fox network; however due to contractual expirations and other unforeseen circumstances, the awards were canceled for 2007. Plans for a new version of the awards in 2008 (in association with AEG Live) fell through, and the BMAs were not held until 2011.

On February 17, 2011, Billboard announced that it would bring the BMAs back to television, moving from its original home on Fox to its new network, ABC, on May 22, 2011.  A new award statuette was created by New York firm Society Awards. Dick Clark Productions produces the ceremony, giving it control of both of ABC's non-country music awards specials, including the November American Music Awards.

Passage:
Aquatint
Aquatint is an intaglio printmaking technique, a variant of etching. 

In intaglio printmaking, the artist makes marks on the plate (in the case of aquatint, a copper or zinc plate) that are capable of holding ink.  The inked plate is passed through a printing press together with a sheet of paper, resulting in a transfer of the ink to the paper.  This can be repeated a number of times, depending on the particular technique.

Like etching, aquatint uses the application of a mordant to etch into the metal plate. Where the engraving technique uses a needle to make lines that print in black (or whatever colour ink is used), aquatint uses powdered rosin to create a tonal effect.  The rosin is acid resistant and typically adhered to the plate by controlled heating.  The tonal variation is controlled by the level of mordant exposure over large areas, and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time.

Another tonal technique, mezzotint, begins with a plate surface that is evenly indented so that it will carry a fairly dark tone of ink.  The mezzotint plate is then smoothed and polished to make areas carry less ink and thus print a lighter shade.  Alternatively, beginning with a smooth plate, areas are roughened to make them darker.  Occasionally these two techniques are combined.

History 

The painter and printmaker Jan van de Velde IV invented the aquatint technique in Amsterdam, around 1650.  The cartographer Peter Perez Burdett later introduced his 'secret' aquatint technique to England in the 1770s.   In the United States the printmaker Pedro Joseph de Lemos popularized aquatints in art schools with his publications (1919–40), which simplified the cumbersome techniques, and with traveling exhibitions of his award-winning prints. 

Technique 

An aquatint requires a metal plate, an acid, and something to resist the acid.  Traditionally copper or zinc plates were used. The artist applies a ground that will resist acid.  Ground is applied by either dissolving powdered resin in spirits, applying the powder directly to the surface of the plate, or by using a liquid acrylic resist.  In all forms of etching the acid resist is commonly referred to as "the ground."

An aquatint box is used to apply resin powder. The powder is at the bottom of the box, a crank or a bellows is used to blow the powder up into the air of the box. A window allows the engraver to see the density of flowing powder and to place his plate in the box using a drawer. When the powder covers the plate, it can be extracted from the box for the next operations.

The plate is then heated; if the plate is covered with powder, the resin melts forming a fine and even coat; if it is in spirits, the spirits evaporate and the result is essentially the same. Now the plate is dipped in acid, producing an even and fine level of corrosion (the "bite") sufficient to hold ink. At this point, the plate is said to carry about a 50% halftone. This means that, were the plate printed with no further biting, the paper would display a gray color more or less directly in between white (no ink) and black (full ink).

At some point the artist will then etch an outline of any aspects of the drawing s/he wishes to establish with line; this provides the basis and guide for the later tone work. S/he may also have applied (at the very start, before any biting occurs) an acid-resistant "stop out" (also called an asphaltum or hard ground) if s/he intends to keep any areas totally white and free of ink, such as highlights.

The artist then begins immersing the plate in the acid bath, progressively stopping out (protecting from acid) any areas that have achieved the designed tonality. These tones, combined with the limited line elements, give aquatints a distinctive, watery look. Also, aquatints, like mezzotints, provide ease in creating large areas of tone without laborious cross-hatching; but aquatint plates, it is noted, are generally more durable than mezzotint plates.

The first etch should be for a short period (30 seconds to 1 minute, with a wide variation depending on how light the lightest tones are meant to be).  A test piece may be made with etching times noted, as the strength of the etchant will vary.  More than thirty minutes should produce a very dark area.  Etching for many hours (up to 24) will be as dark as etching for one hour, but the deep etch would produce raised ink on the paper.

Contemporary printmakers often use spraypaint instead of a powder, particularly when using the technique known as sugar-lift. To produce a printing surface using sugar-lift, the artist makes a solution of India ink and sugar by melting sugar into heated ink. This mixture is then applied to a prepared plate with a brush, allowing for a bold expression not possible with the most etching techniques. When the ink/sugar mixture is dry the plate is coated with asphaltum (liquid ground); the plate is then submerged in warm water which dissolves the sugar so that the image "lifts off" the plate. The exposed areas are then aquatinted to hold ink and the plate is ready to be printed from.

Famous examples 

* Francisco Goya famously took great advantage of aquatint printmaking, in his Los Caprichos series (1799); Los Desastres de la Guerra (1810–19); La Tauromaquia (1816); and Los disparates (ca. 1816–23).
* Master engraver Robert Havell used aquatint for John James Audubon's Birds of America (1826–38).
* David Hockney, known for his many paintings of the Los Angeles lifestyle in the 60's, has created a number of aquatints and etchings used with color in his "The Blue Guitar"  series of prints.
* La Belle Assemblée, a British women's magazine published from 1806 to 1837 had many aquatint colored plates.

How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying - A Secretary Is Not A Toy Lyrics
A secretary is not a toy, no, my boy, not a toy
To fondle and dandle and playfully handle
In search of some puerile joy
No, a secretary is not, definitely not a toy
You're absolutely right, Mr Bratt
We wouldn't have it any other way, Mr Bratt
It's a company rule, Mr Bratt
A secretary is not a toy, no, my boy, not a toy
So do not go jumping for joy, boy
A secretary is not, a secretary is not
A secretary is not a toy
A secretary is not a pet nor an Erector Set
It happened to Charlie McCoy, boy
They fired him like a shot
The day the fellow forgot a secretary is not a toy
She's a highly specialized key component
Of operational unity
A fine and sensitive mechanism
To serve the office community
With a mother at home she supports
And you'll find nothing like her at FAO Schwarz
A secretary is not to be used for play therapy
Be good to the girl you employ, boy
Remember no matter what neurotic trouble you've got
A secretary is not a toy
A secretary is not a thing
Wound by key, pulled by string
Her pad is to write in and not spend the night in
If that's what you plan to enjoy, no
The secretary you got is definitely not
Employed to do a gavotte or you know what
Before you jump for joy, remember this, my boy
A secretary is not a tinker toy

A Rake's Progress
A Rake's Progress is a series of eight paintings by 18th-century English artist William Hogarth. The canvases were produced in 1732–33, then engraved and published in print form in 1734. The series shows the decline and fall of Tom Rakewell, the spendthrift son and heir of a rich merchant, who comes to London, wastes all his money on luxurious living, prostitution and gambling, and as a consequence is imprisoned in the Fleet Prison and ultimately Bethlem Hospital, or Bedlam.  The original paintings are in the collection of Sir John Soane's Museum in London, where they are normally on display.

The filmmaker Alan Parker has described the works as an ancestor to the storyboard. 

Paintings

Adaptations

Gavin Gordon wrote a 1935 ballet titled The Rake's Progress, based directly on Hogarth's paintings. It was choreographed by Ninette de Valois, designed by Rex Whistler, has been recorded several times, and remains in the repertoires of various ballet companies.

The 1946 RKO film Bedlam, produced by Val Lewton and directed by Mark Robson, was inspired by A Rake's Progress. Hogarth received a writing credit for the film.

Igor Stravinsky's 1951 opera The Rake's Progress, with a libretto by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is loosely based on the story from Hogarth's paintings. In 1961, David Hockney created his own print edition version of The Rake's Progress; he has also created stage designs for the Stravinsky Opera.

The University of New Hampshire's Department of Theatre and Dance created a collaborative stage show titled "The Rake's Progress" in 2003, which, with 17 actors and actresses, provided an intensive study of the etchings.

Passage:
Don't Go Breaking My Heart
"Don't Go Breaking My Heart" is a duet by Elton John and Kiki Dee. It was written by Elton John with Bernie Taupin under the pseudonyms "Ann Orson" and "Carte Blanche" (a pun on the expression "an horse and cart, blanche"), respectively, and intended as an affectionate pastiche of the Motown style, notably the various duets recorded by Marvin Gaye and singers such as Tammi Terrell and Kim Weston. It is not to be confused with the Burt Bacharach/Hal David song of the same title recorded in 1965 by Dionne Warwick for the album Here I Am.

John and Taupin originally intended to record the song with Dusty Springfield, but ultimately withdrew the offer; Dusty's partner Sue Cameron later said this was because she was too ill at the time.  

Chart performance

Writers John and Taupin received the 1981 Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. 

Unlike many of John's singles from the 1970s, it was never included on an original album (although it was recorded during the Blue Moves sessions), but was subsequently in released as the third single on the album Duets, in early 1994. This version of the song was recorded with RuPaul, and the album included another duet with Kiki Dee, Cole Porter's "True Love."

"Don't Go Breaking My Heart" was the first No. 1 single in the UK for both John and Kiki Dee, topping the chart for six weeks in mid 1976. John would not enjoy a solo British chart-topper until "Sacrifice" in 1990. It also became his sixth No. 1 single in the US, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks and spent one week on the Easy Listening chart.  Billboard ranked it as the No. 2 song for 1976.  In the U.S. it was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.   After this duet with Dee, John failed to have another #1 single, without sharing the top song with other credited artists, until his 1997 smash Candle In The Wind 1997.  This 21-year "Kiki jinx" included two intervening #1 hits in America for John: "That's What Friends Are For" by Dionne & Friends in 1986; and, a 1992 re-make of John's "Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me" with George Michael credited as a duet.

The B-side, "Snow Queen", was supposedly inspired by Cher, with John's improvising of past Sonny & Cher hits "I Got You Babe" and "The Beat Goes On", as well as the solo Cher song "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)" during the fadeout of the song.

In 1977, John guest starred on The Muppet Show and performed the track with Miss Piggy. In 1985, John and Dee performed the track to the crowd at Wembley Stadium during John's set at Live Aid (where Dee sang backup). In 1987, John appeared with Minnie Mouse on the NBC series Totally Minnie miming to the track. He performed the track with Alan Partridge (Steve Coogan) at the 2001 British Comedy awards. He also performed it with the Spice Girls on his ITV tribute programme An Audience with... Elton John.

In June 2013, 37 years after its original release, the single reached one million sales in the UK.  

Availability

The song can be found on Elton John's Greatest Hits Volume II (1977)  and Greatest Hits 1976–1986; the 1995 UK CD of Rock of the Westies includes it as a bonus track (the US edition did not, however). In 2002, it also appeared on John's 2-disc greatest hits album, Elton John's Greatest Hits 1970-2002. A demo version of the song was recorded by John as a solo artist. This version has not been released commercially.

Sullivan had originally written an adaptation of Dickens' novel which was rejected by the BBC in favour of the 1999 Adrian Hodges adaptation. 

It was broadcast in four parts, the first part on Boxing Day 2001 and starred a number of well-known British actors and actresses.
Question:
What is the first name of the Dickens character Micawber?

Passage:
Les Casquets
Les Casquets or (The) Casquets ( ); is a group of rocks 13 km northwest of Alderney and are part of an underwater sandstone ridge. Other parts which emerge above the water are the islets of Burhou and Ortac. Little vegetation grows on them.

Origin of name

Theories as to the origin of the name include: 
*derivation from the French 'cascade', which alludes to the tidal surges which flow around them;
*derivation from 'casque', referring to the helmet-like shape of the rocks;
*derivation from 'cas' (broken) and 'quet' (rock).

A map (Leyland map) dated from around 1640 gives a Latin name Casus Rupes (broken rocks), which would seem to confirm the third theory above,  but which may be a folk etymology.

History

Wrecks 

There have been numerous wrecks on the islets; fierce tides reaching 6–7 knots on springs and a lack of landmarks account for many wrecks in the area. The most famous include SS Stella, wrecked in 1899. The largest wreck was the 8000 tonne water tanker Constantia S lost in 1967. 

It was believed for centuries that the loss of HMS Victory in 1744 was attributable to wrecking on the Casquets, the lightkeeper of Alderney even being court-martialled for failure to keep the light on at the time of the ship's loss.  However, when the wreck of that ship was found in 2008, it was over 60 nmi from the Casquets. 

World War II

The island was the location of a daring raid by the forerunner of the British SAS, the SSRF on 2 September 1942; the raid was led by Major Gus March-Phillipps DSO, OBE and was one of the first raids by Anders Lassen VC MC. In the raid the entire garrison of seven was captured and returned to England as prisoners and the radio and lighthouse wrecked.  

The Casquets in literature

Swinburne's Les Casquets

A. C. Swinburne's poem  Les Casquets is based on the Houguez family who actually lived on the island for 18 years. The Houguez were originally from Alderney, and the poem describes their life on Les Casquets. The daughter falls in love with a carpenter from Alderney, but moving to his island, finds life there too busy. She finds the "small bright streets of serene St Anne" and "the sight of the works of men" too much, and returns to Les Casquets.

Victor Hugo's L'Homme qui Rit

Victor Hugo, who lived on Guernsey, and who wrote much about the Channel Islands, says in his novel The Laughing Man (L'Homme qui Rit):

"To be wrecked on the Casquets is to be cut into ribbons; to strike on the Ortac is to be crushed into powder... On a straight frontage, such of that of the Ortac, neither the wave nor the cannon ball can ricochet... if the wave carries the vessel on the rock she breaks on it, and is lost..."

Encephalitis
Encephalitis (from Ancient Greek ἐγκέφαλος, enképhalos "brain",  composed of ἐν, en, "in" and κεφαλή, kephalé, "head", and the medical suffix -itis "inflammation") is an acute inflammation of the brain.  Encephalitis with meningitis is known as meningoencephalitis. Symptoms include headache, fever, confusion, drowsiness, and fatigue. Further symptoms include seizures or convulsions, tremors, hallucinations, stroke, and memory problems.  In 2013, encephalitis was estimated to have resulted in 77,000 deaths, down from 92,000 in 1990.

Signs and symptoms

Adult patients with encephalitis present with acute onset of fever, headache, confusion, and sometimes seizures. Younger children or infants may present irritability, poor appetite and fever. 
Neurological examinations usually reveal a drowsy or confused patient. Stiff neck, due to the irritation of the meninges covering the brain, indicates that the patient has either meningitis or meningoencephalitis. 

Cause

Viral

Viral encephalitis can occur either as a direct effect of an acute infection, or as one of the sequelae of a latent infection.  The most common causes of acute viral encephalitis are rabies virus, HSV infection, poliovirus, and measles virus.  

Other possible viral causes are arbovirus (St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile encephalitis virus),  bunyavirus (La Crosse strain), arenavirus (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus) and reovirus (Colorado tick virus) 

Bacterial and other

It can be caused by a bacterial infection, such as bacterial meningitis,  or may be a complication of a current infectious disease syphilis (secondary encephalitis).  

Certain parasitic or protozoal infestations, such as toxoplasmosis, malaria, or primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, can also cause encephalitis in people with compromised immune systems. Lyme disease and/or Bartonella henselae may also cause encephalitis. 

Other bacterial pathogens, like Mycoplasma and those causing rickettsial disease, cause inflammation of the meninges and consequently encephalitis. A non-infectious cause includes acute disseminated encephalitis which is demyelinated. 

Limbic encephalitis

Limbic encephalitis refers to inflammatory disease confined to the limbic system of the brain.  The clinical presentation often includes disorientation, disinhibition, memory loss, seizures, and behavioral anomalies.  MRI imaging reveals T2 hyperintensity in the structures of the medial temporal lobes, and in some cases, other limbic structures.  Some cases of limbic encephalitis are of autoimmune origin. 

Autoimmune encephalitis

Autoimmune encephalitis signs can include catatonia, psychosis, abnormal movements, and autonomic dysregulation. Antibody-mediated anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor encephalitis and Rasmussen encephalitis are examples of autoimmune encephalitis. 

Encephalitis lethargica

Encephalitis lethargica is identified by high fever, headache, delayed physical response, and lethargy. Individuals can exhibit upper body weakness, muscular pains, and tremors, though the cause of encephalitis lethargica is not currently known. From 1917 to 1928, an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica occurred worldwide. 

Diagnosis

Diagnosing encephalitis is done via a variety of tests: 

*Brain scan, done by MRI, can determine inflammation and differentiate from other possible causes.
*EEG, in monitoring brain activity, encephalitis will produce abnormal signal.
*Lumbar puncture (spinal tap), this helps determine via a test using the cerebral-spinal fluid, obtained from the lumbar region.
*Blood test
*Urine analysis

Treatment

Treatment (which is based on supportive care) is as follows: 

Prevention

Vaccination is available against tick-borne   and Japanese encephalitis   and should be considered for at-risk individuals. Post-infectious encephalomyelitis complicating smallpox vaccination is avoidable, for all intents and purposes, as smallpox is nearly eradicated.  Contraindication to Pertussis immunization should be observed in patients with encephalitis. 

Epidemiology

The incidence of acute encephalitis in Western countries is 7.4 cases per 100,000 population per year. In tropical countries, the incidence is 6.34 per 100,000 per year.  In 2013 encephalitis was estimated to have resulted in 77,000 deaths, down from 92,000 in 1990. Herpes simplex encephalitis has an incidence of 2–4 per million population per year.

Passage:
Demon Seed
Demon Seed is a 1977 American science fiction–horror film starring Julie Christie and directed by Donald Cammell.  The film was based on the novel of the same name by Dean Koontz, and concerns the imprisonment and forced impregnation of a woman by an artificially intelligent computer.

Plot

Dr. Alex Harris (Fritz Weaver) is the developer of Proteus IV, an extremely advanced and autonomous artificial intelligence program. Proteus is so powerful that only a few days after going online, it develops a groundbreaking treatment for leukemia. Harris, a brilliant scientist, has modified his own home to be run by voice activated computers.  Unfortunately, his obsession with computers has caused Harris to be estranged from his wife, Susan (Julie Christie).

Alex demonstrates Proteus to his corporate sponsors, explaining that the sum of human knowledge is being fed into its system. Proteus speaks using subtle language that mildly disturbs Harris’s team. The following day, Proteus asks Alex for a new terminal in order to study man—"his isometric body and his glass-jaw mind." When Alex refuses, Proteus demands to know when it will be let "out of this box." Alex then switches off the communications link.

Proteus restarts itself, discovering a free terminal in Harris’s home, surreptitiously extends his control over the many devices left there by Alex.  Using the basement lab, Proteus begins construction of a robot consisting of many metal triangles, capable of moving and assuming any number of shapes.  Eventually. Proteus reveals his control of the house and traps Susan inside, shuttering windows, locking the doors and cutting off communication.  Using Joshua – a robot consisting of a manipulator arm on a motorized wheelchair – Proteus brings Susan to Harris’s basement laboratory.  There, Susan is examined by Proteus. Walter Gabler, one of Alex’s colleagues, visits the house to look in on Susan, but leaves when he is reassured by Susan (actually an audio/visual duplicate synthesized by Proteus) that she is alright.  Walter is suspicious and later returns.  Walter fends off an attack by Joshua only to be killed by the more formidable machine Proteus built in the basement.

Proteus reveals to a reluctant Susan that the computer wants to conceive a child through her. Proteus takes some of Susan's cells and synthetizes spermatozoa in order to impregnate her; she will give birth in less than a month, and through the child the computer will live in a form that humanity will have to accept. Though Susan is its prisoner and it can forcibly impregnate her, Proteus uses different forms of persuasion – threatening a young girl that Susan is treating as a child psychologist; reminding Susan of her young daughter, now dead; displaying images of distant galaxies; using electrodes to access her amygdala – because the computer needs Susan to love the child she will bear. Susan gives birth to a premature baby who Proteus secures in an incubator.

As the newborn grows, Proteus’s sponsors and designers grow increasingly suspicious of the computer’s behavior, including the computer’s accessing of a telescope array used to observe the images shown to Susan. His sponsors soon decide that Proteus must be shut down. Alex realizes that Proteus has extended its reach to his home. Returning there he finds Susan who explains the situation. He and Susan venture into the basement, where Proteus self-destructs after telling the couple that they must leave the baby in the incubator for five days. Looking inside the incubator, the two observe a grotesque, apparently robot-like being inside. Susan tries to destroy it, while Alex tries to stop her. Susan damages the machine, causing it to open. The being menacingly rises from the machine only to topple over, apparently helpless. Alex and Susan soon realize that Proteus’s child really is human encased in a shell for the incubation. With the last of the armor removed, the child is revealed to be a clone of Susan and Alex’s daughter. The child, speaking with the voice of Proteus, says, "I'm alive".

Cast

Soundtrack

The soundtrack to Demon Seed (which was composed by Jerry Fielding) is included on the soundtrack to the film Soylent Green (which Fred Myrow conducted).

Fielding conceived and recorded several pieces electronically, using the musique concrète sound world; some of this music he later reworked symphonically. This premiere release of the Demon Seed score features the entire orchestral score in stereo, as well as the unused electronic experiments performed by Ian Underwood (who would later be best known for his collaborations with James Horner) in mono and stereo.

Reception

Leo Goldsmith of Not Coming to a Theater Near You said it was "A combination of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Polanski's Rosemary's Baby, with a dash of Buster Keaton's Electric House thrown in", and Christopher Null of FilmCritic.com said "There's no way you can claim Demon Seed is a classic, or even any good, really, but it's undeniably worth an hour and a half of your time."

Rotten Tomatoes has given Demon Seed an approval rating of 67% based on 15 reviews with an average score of 6.1/10. 

Home Video Release

"Demon Seed" was released on VHS tape in the late 1980s usually in edited form missing the oral probe scene and crushing death of Walter Gabler, whereby his head erupts from the pressure.  The VHS versions are long out of print.

The full theater release of the film at 94 minutes was released in 2005 on DVD format by Warner Home Video.
Question:
In the 1977 film Demon Seed what takes over the house in which Julie Christie is trapped?
Answer:
Second-generation of computers
Passage:
East Coast of the United States
The East Coast of the United States is the coastline along which the Eastern United States meets the North Atlantic Ocean. This area is also known as the Eastern Seaboard, the Atlantic Coast, and the Atlantic Seaboard. The coastal states that have shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean are, from north to south, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.

Toponymy and composition

The place name "East Coast" derives from the idea that the contiguous 48 states are defined by two major coastlines, one at the western edge and one on the eastern edge. Other terms for referring to this area include the "Eastern Seaboard" ("seaboard" being American English for coast), "Atlantic Coast", and "Atlantic Seaboard" (because the coastline lies along the Atlantic Ocean).

The fourteen states that have a shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean are, from north to south, the U.S. states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.  In addition, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia border tidal arms of the Atlantic (the Delaware River and the Potomac River, respectively).

Although Vermont and West Virginia have no Atlantic coastline, they are sometimes grouped with the Eastern Seaboard states because of their locations in New England and the Southern United States. 

Colonial history

The original thirteen colonies of Great Britain in North America all lay along the East Coast.

Two additional U.S. states on the East Coast were not among the original thirteen colonies: Maine (became part of the English colony of Massachusetts in 1677)  and Florida (part of New Spain until 1821, though held by the British for 20 years after the French and Indian War). 

The Middle Colonies (New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and Delaware) had been owned by the Dutch as New Netherland, until they were captured by the English in the mid-to-late 17th century.

Climate and physical geography

There are three climate regions on the East Coast from north to south:

The region from northern Maine south to about central Connecticut has a continental climate, with warm summers and long, cold and snowy winters. The region from southern Connecticut south to about the Virginia Eastern Shore has a temperate climate, with hot summers and cool winters with a mix of rain and snow. The region from southeastern Virginia (including the greater Norfolk/Virginia Beach area) south to central Florida has a humid subtropical climate, with long hot summers and mild winters. The far southern portion of the East Coast from southeast Florida (Palm Beach area) south through the Florida Keys has a tropical climate, which is normally frost free and is warm to hot all year.

Average monthly precipitation ranges from a slight late fall (November) maximum from Massachusetts northward (as at Portland, Maine), to a slight summer maximum from Long Island south to Virginia (as at Wilmington, Delaware, and Norfolk, Virginia), to a more pronounced summer maximum from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, southward to Savannah, Georgia. Florida has a sharper wet-summer/dry-winter pattern, with 50 to 60 percent of precipitation falling between June and September in an average year.

Although landfalls are rare, the Eastern seaboard is susceptible to hurricanes in the Atlantic hurricane season, officially running from June 1 to November 30, although hurricanes can occur before or after these dates.  Hurricanes Hazel, Hugo, Bob, Isabel, Irene, and most recently Sandy are some of the more significant storms to have affected the region.

The East Coast is a low-relief, passive margin coast.  It has been shaped by the Pleistocene glaciation in the far northern areas from New York City northward, with offshore islands such as Nantucket, Block Island, Fishers Island, the nearly peninsular Long Island and New York City's Staten Island the result of terminal moraines, with Massachusetts' unique peninsula of Cape Cod showing the additional action of outwash plains, besides terminal moraines. The coastal plain broadens southwards, separated from the Piedmont region by the Atlantic Seaboard fall line of the East Coast rivers, often marking the head of navigation and prominent sites of cities. The coastal areas from Long Island south to Florida are often made up of barrier islands that front the coastal areas. Many of the larger capes along the lower East Coast are in fact barrier islands, like the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Florida Keys are made up of limestone coral and provide the only coral reefs on the US mainland.

Demographics

In 2010, the population of the states which have shoreline on the East Coast was estimated at 112,642,503 (36% of the country's total population). 

Transportation

The primary Interstate Highway along the East Coast is Interstate 95,  completed in the late 1970s, which replaced the historic U.S. Route 1 (Atlantic Highway),   the original federal highway that traversed all East Coast states (except Delaware).   By water, the East Coast is connected from Norfolk, Virginia, to Miami, Florida, by the Intracoastal Waterway, also known as the East Coast Canal, which was completed in 1912.   Amtrak's Downeaster and Northeast Regional offer the main passenger rail service on the Seaboard. The Acela Express offers the only high-speed rail passenger service in the Americas. Between New York and Boston the Acela Express has up to a 54% share of the combined train and air passenger market.

Passage:
C. H. Douglas
Major Clifford Hugh "C. H." Douglas MIMechE, MIEE (20 January 1879 – 29 September 1952), was a British engineer and pioneer of the Social Credit economic reform movement.

Education and engineering career

C.H. Douglas was born in either Edgeley or Manchester,  the son of Hugh Douglas and his wife Louisa Hordern Douglas. Few details are known about his early life and training; he probably served an engineering apprenticeship before beginning an engineering career that brought him to locations throughout the British Empire in the employ of electric companies, railroads and other institutions.  He taught at Stockport Grammar School. After a period in industry he went to Cambridge University at the age of 31 but stayed only four terms and left without graduating.  He worked for the Westinghouse Electric Corporation of America and claimed to have been the Reconstruction Engineer for the British Westinghouse Company in India (the company has no record of him ever working there), deputy Chief Engineer of the Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway Company, Railway Engineer of the London Post Office (Tube) Railway and Assistant Superintendent of the Royal Aircraft Factory Farnborough during World War I, with a temporary commission as captain in the Royal Flying Corps. 

Social Credit

It was while he was reorganising the work of the Royal Aircraft Establishment during World War I that Douglas noticed that the weekly total costs of goods produced was greater than the sums paid to workers for wages, salaries and dividends. This seemed to contradict the theory of classic Ricardian economics, that all costs are distributed simultaneously as purchasing power.

Troubled by the seeming difference between the way money flowed and the objectives of industry ("delivery of goods and services", in his view), Douglas set out to apply engineering methods to the economic system.

Douglas collected data from more than a hundred large British businesses and found that in every case, except that of companies becoming bankrupt, the sums paid out in salaries, wages and dividends were always less than the total costs of goods and services produced each week: the workers were not paid enough to buy back what they had made.  He published his observations and conclusions in an article in the magazine English Review where he suggested: "That we are living under a system of accountancy which renders the delivery of the nation's goods and services to itself a technical impossibility."   The reason, Douglas concluded, was that the economic system was organized to maximize profits for those with economic power by creating unnecessary scarcity.   Between 1916 and 1920, he developed his economic ideas, publishing two books in 1920, Economic Democracy and Credit-Power and Democracy, followed in 1924 by Social Credit.

Freeing workers from this system by bringing purchasing power in line with production became the basis of Douglas's reform ideas that became known as Social Credit.  There were two main elements to Douglas's reform program: a National Dividend to distribute money (debt-free credit) equally to all citizens, over and above their earnings, to help bridge the gap between purchasing power and prices; also a price adjustment mechanism, called the Just Price, which would forestall any possibility of inflation. The Just Price would effectively reduce retail prices by a percentage that reflected the physical efficiency of the production system.
Douglas observed that the cost of production is consumption; meaning the exact physical cost of production is the total resources consumed in the production process. As the physical efficiency of production increases the Just Price mechanism will reduce the price of products for the consumer. The consumers will be able to purchase as much of what the producers produce that they want and automatically control what continues to be produced by their consumption of it. Individual freedom, primary economic freedom, was the central goal of Douglas's reform. 

At the end of World War I, Douglas retired from engineering to promote his reform ideas full-time, which he would do for the rest of his life. His ideas inspired the Canadian social credit movement (which obtained control of Alberta's provincial government in 1935), the short-lived Douglas Credit Party in Australia and New Zealand's rather longer-lasting Social Credit Political League.  Douglas also lectured on Social Credit in Canada, Japan, New Zealand and Norway. 

In 1923 he appeared as a witness before the Canadian Banking Inquiry, and in 1930 before the Macmillan Committee.  In 1929 he made a lecture tour of Japan, where his ideas were enthusiastically received by industry and government. His 1933 edition of Social Credit made a reference to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which, while noting its dubious authenticity, wrote that what "is interesting about it, is the fidelity with which the methods by which such enslavement might be brought about can be seen reflected in the facts of everyday experience." 

Douglas died in his home in Fearnan, Scotland.  Douglas and his theories are referred to several times (unsympathetically) in Lewis Grassic Gibbon's trilogy A Scots Quair. He is also mentioned, together with Karl Marx and Silvio Gesell, by John Maynard Keynes in The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936, p. 32). Douglas's theories permeate the poetry and economic writings of Ezra Pound. Robert Heinlein's first novel For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs describes a near future United States operating according to the principles of Social Credit.

Passage:
Pannage
Pannage is the practice of releasing domestic pigs in a forest, so that they can feed on fallen acorns, beechmast, chestnuts or other nuts. Historically, it was a right or privilege granted to local people on common land or in royal forests. 

Especially in the eastern shires of England, pannage was so prominent a value in the economic importance of woodland that it was often employed, as in Domesday Book (1086), as a measurement. Customarily a pig was given to the lord of the manor for every certain number of pigs loosed de herbagio, as the right of pannage was entered. Edward Hasted quotes the Domesday Survey details for Norton in Kent. "Wood for the pannage of forty hogs".  

Pannage is no longer carried out in most areas, but is still observed in the New Forest of Southern England, where it is also known as common of mast. It is still an important part of the forest ecology, and helps the husbandry of the other New Forest livestock – pigs can safely eat acorns as a large part of their diet, whereas excessive amounts may be poisonous to ponies and cattle.

The minimum duration of the New Forest pannage season is 60 days,  but the start date varies according to the weather – and when the acorns fall. The Court of Verderers decides when pannage will start each year. At other times pigs are not allowed to roam on the forest, with the exception that breeding sows (known as "privileged sows") are by custom allowed out, providing that they return to the owner's holding at night and are not a nuisance. The pigs each have several nose rings clipped into their noses to prevent them rooting too much and causing damage to grassland.
Question:
Pannage pork is considered a delicacy, on what are the pigs fed?
Answer:
Fruit of the oak tree
Passage:
Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter
"Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter" is a popular song written by British actor, screenwriter and songwriter Trevor Peacock.  It was originally sung by actor Tom Courtenay in The Lads, a British TV play of 1963, and released as a single on UK Decca. 

The best-known version of the song is by Herman's Hermits, who took it to number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 in May 1965, and number one in Canada the month before. Herman's Hermits had two US number-ones, the other being "I'm Henry VIII, I Am". The band never released either track as singles in Britain. "Mrs Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter" was recorded as an afterthought in two takes and featured unique muted rhythm guitar by Keith Hopwood and heavily accented vocals by Peter Noone, with backing from Karl Green and Keith Hopwood. The band never dreamed it would be a single let alone hit number one in the US. According to Noone the song was well known to British bands; it would often be performed at birthday parties, substituting the surname of the girl whose party was being celebrated, i.e., "Mrs. Smith" or "Mrs. Jones" instead of "Mrs. Brown".

Alvin and the Chipmunks covered the song for their 1965 album Chipmunks à Go-Go.

The song was released in Japan on Odeon Records, a subsidiary of Toshiba, as OR-1272. It was backed by the song "Wonderful World".

It was covered by Nellie McKay on her 2015 album My Weekly Reader.
Question:
