Passage:
Gideon of Scotland Yard
Commander George Gideon of Scotland Yard is a fictional policeman who appeared in 26 police procedural novels, created by John Creasey who wrote 21 novels featuring this character under the pseudonym J.J. Marric, published between 1955 and 1976. The series was subsequently continued in a further 5 novels by William Vivian Butler.

The character 

George Gideon ("G.G." or "Gee-Gee" to coppers and crooks alike) is powerfully built but has a gentle voice. He has pale-blue eyes.  He is famed for his prodigious feats of memory and his ability to handle a bewildering work-load of cases simultaneously. Despite his seniority in rank, Gideon often takes a hands-on approach and on occasions physically engages with criminals.  He is universally loved and respected by his staff - but they know to avoid him when his temper is aroused. In the first novel, Gideon's Day he holds the rank of Detective Superintendent, but in the second Gideon's Week, he has been promoted to Commander, and is the operational head of the Yard's entire CID, a position he holds for the rest of the series.  

One of Creasey's technical advisers for the series was Commander George Hatherill, who had organized the British Army's Special Investigation Branch during World War II, and was the operational head of the London Metropolitan Police from 1954 through 1964 (the same position Gideon held in fiction) during which time he was awarded the OBE.  Hatherill is generally believed to have been Creasey's model for Gideon.

Family 

He is married to Kate.   When we first meet Gideon, this relationship is strained by the relatively recent loss of a child - but the Gideons' marriage survives. George and Kate have six surviving children (in the books - the number being trimmed in the TV series).  Penny, their youngest, marries Alec Hobbs, Gideon's deputy and a widower.  By the time Gideon's Way was published (1983), Alec and Penny have a son, George.

Film and TV 

In Gideon's Day (1958, directed by John Ford, USA title: Gideon Of Scotland Yard), Gideon is played by Jack Hawkins. The co-stars were Anna Lee, Dianne Foster, Ronald Howard, 
Cyril Cusack, and Andrew Ray. The film was released by Columbia Pictures.
 
A 26-part TV series Gideon's Way (USA title: Gideon C.I.D.) was made in 1964, starring John Gregson, which ran until 1966 in the UK, produced by ITC Entertainment.

Passage:
The Gates of Hell
The Gates of Hell () is a monumental sculptural group work by French artist Auguste Rodin that depicts a scene from "The Inferno", the first section of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. It stands at 6 metres high, 4 metres wide and 1 metre deep (6 *) and contains 180 figures. The figures range from 15 cm high up to more than one metre (3 ft). Several of the figures were also cast independently by Rodin.

History

The sculpture was commissioned by the Directorate of Fine Arts in 1880 and was meant to be delivered in 1885.
Rodin would continue to work on and off on this project for 37 years, until his death in 1917.

The Directorate asked for an inviting entrance to a planned Decorative Arts Museum with the theme being left to Rodin's selection. Even before this commission, Rodin had developed sketches of some of Dante's characters based on his admiration of Dante's Inferno. 

The Decorative Arts Museum was never built. Rodin worked on this project on the ground floor of the Hôtel Biron. Near the end of his life, Rodin donated sculptures, drawings and reproduction rights to the French government. In 1919, two years after his death, The Hôtel Biron became the Musée Rodin housing a cast of The Gates of Hell and related works.

Inspiration for The Gates of Hell

A work of the scope of The Gates of Hell had not been attempted before, but inspiration came from Lorenzo Ghiberti's Gates of Paradise at the Baptistery of St. John, Florence;  the 15th century bronze doors depict figures from the Old Testament.
Another source of inspiration was medieval cathedrals;  some of those combine both high and low relief.
Rodin was also inspired by Michelangelo's fresco The Last Judgment, Delacroix's painting The Barque of Dante, Balzac's collection La Comédie humaine and Baudelaire's poems Les Fleurs du mal.

In an article by Serge Basset printed in Le Matin in 1890, Rodin said: "For a whole year I lived with Dante, with him alone, drawing the circles of his inferno. At the end of this year, I realized that while my drawing rendered my vision of Dante, they had become too remote from reality. So I started all over again, working from nature, with my models."

Outstanding figures

The original sculptures were enlarged and became works of art of their own.

* The Thinker (Le Penseur), also called The Poet, is located above the door panels. One interpretation suggests that it might represent Dante looking down to the characters in the Inferno. Another interpretation is that the Thinker is Rodin himself meditating about his composition. Others believe that the figure may be Adam, contemplating the destruction brought upon mankind because of his sin.
* The Kiss (Le Baiser) was originally in The Gate along with other figures of Paolo and Francesca da Rimini. Rodin wanted to represent their initial joy as well as their final damnation. He removed the figure that became known as The Kiss because it seemed to conflict with the other suffering figures.
* Ugolino and His Children (Ugolin et ses enfants) depicts Ugolino della Gherardesca, who according to the story, ate the corpses of his children after they died by starvation (Dante, Inferno, Canto XXXIII). The Ugolino group was cast as a separate bronze in 1882.
* The Three Shades (Les Trois Ombres) was originally 98 cm high. The over-life size group was initially made of three independent figures in 1899. Later on, Rodin replaced one hand in the figures to fuse them together, in the same form as the smaller version.  The figures originally pointed to the phrase "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate" ("Abandon all hope, ye who enter here") from Canto III of the Inferno. 
* Fleeting Love (Fugit Amor) is located on the right door pane, it is one of several figures of lovers that represent Paolo and Francesca da Rimini. The male figure is also called The Prodigal.
* Paolo and Francesca is shown on the left door pane. Paolo tries to reach Francesca, who seems to slip away.
* Meditation appears on the rightmost part of the tympanum, shown as an enlarged figure in 1896.
* The Old Courtesan is a bronze cast from 1910 of an aged, naked female body. The sculpture is also called She Who Was Once the Helmet-Maker's Beautiful Wife (Celle qui fut la belle heaulmière). This title is taken from a poem by François Villon.
* I Am Beautiful (Je suis belle), cast in 1882, is among the second set of figures on the extreme right portion of the door.
* Eternal Springtime (L'Éternel printemps) was cast in 1884.  It exists in several separate versions, both in marble and in bronze.
* Adam and Eve. Rodin asked the directorate for additional funds for the independent sculptures of Adam and Eve that were meant to frame The Gates of Hell. However, Rodin found he could not get Eve's figure right. Consequently, several figures of Eve were made, none of which were used, and all of them were later sold.

Locations 

The plaster original was restored in 1917 and is displayed at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. A series of plaster casts illustrating the development of the work is on view at the Musée Rodin in Meudon.  Also in 1917, a model was used to make the original three bronze casts: 
* The Musée Rodin, Paris. 
* The Rodin Museum, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
* The National Museum of Western Art in Ueno Park, Tokyo. 

Subsequent bronzes have been distributed by the Musée Rodin to a number of locations, including:
* The Kunsthaus Zürich, Zurich
* The Iris & B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts at Stanford University
* The [http://www.plateau.or.kr/en/html/index.asp Plateau], Seoul, Korea
* Museo Soumaya, Mexico City

Passage:
Goneril
Goneril is a character in Shakespeare's tragic play King Lear (1605). She is the eldest of King Lear's three daughters. Along with her sister Regan, Goneril is considered a villain,  obsessed with power and overthrowing her elderly father as ruler of the kingdom of Britain. Her aggressiveness is a rare trait for a female character in Elizabethan literature.

Shakespeare based the character on Gonorilla, a personage described by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his pseudohistorical chronicle Historia regum Britanniae ("History of the Kings of Britain", ) as the eldest of the British king Lear's three daughters, alongside Regan and Cordeilla (the source for Cordelia), and the mother of Marganus.

Analysis

The earliest example of her deceitful tendencies occurs in the first act. Without a male heir, Lear is prepared to divide his kingdom among his three daughters, as long as they express their true love to him. Knowing her response will get her closer to the throne, Goneril professes, "Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter" (1.1. 53).  She has no reservations about lying to her father.

She finally begins to show her true colours when Lear asks to stay with her and her husband. She tells him to send away his knights and servants because they are too loud and too numerous. Livid that he is being disrespected, Lear curses her and leaves.

Goneril, the wife of the Duke of Albany (an archaic name for Scotland), has an intimate relationship with Edmund, one that may have been played up in the earlier editions of King Lear.  She writes a note encouraging Edmund to kill her husband and marry her, but it is discovered. In the final act, Goneril discovers that Regan has a sexual desire for Edmund as well and poisons her sister’s drink. However, once Edmund is mortally wounded, Goneril goes offstage and kills herself.
