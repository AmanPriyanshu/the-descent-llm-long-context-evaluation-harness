Passage:
Sussex pond pudding
Sussex pond pudding is a traditional English pudding from the South East county of Sussex. Made of a suet pastry which encases a whole lemon, with butter and sugar, it is boiled or steamed for several hours. The dish is first recorded in Hannah Woolley's 1672 book, The Queen-Like Closet.

This rich and heavy pudding has gone out of fashion over the years due to health and diet consciousness, although  the British chef Heston Blumenthal is trying to revive this type of traditional cookery.

A variant, Currant pond pudding, is known from both Sussex and Kent. 

Preparation

While cooking, the filling ingredients create a thick, caramelized sauce, which upon serving and cutting of the pudding, runs out and pools around the plate, creating a “pond”.  After cooking for so long, the skin of the lemon almost candies like a marmalade in its own juices and that of the butter and sugar.

The most authentic recipes call for beef suet for making the pastry which is available in all supermarkets in the UK, but vegetable shortening, or even cold butter, can be substituted for similar results.

The best lemons to use in this pudding are thin skinned, juicy ones that have not been waxed.

History

The first recorded recipe for the Sussex pond pudding was in Hannah Woolley's The Queen-Like Closet (1672). Woolley suggests encasing a whole apple. 

Much older cookery books and recipes do not actually call for use of a lemon at all.  Here is one found by Florence White: 

”This was given us at Chailey, Sussex, by a nursemaid in 1880 or thereabouts.  It was made for me boiled in a cloth (the correct way) in 1905 by an old cottage woman in the village of Westham.  In Sussex cottages, steak and kidney puddings are still (1931) boiled in a cloth only.” –H.J. Glover

The first recorded use of a version using a whole lemon was in Jane Grigson's English Food (1974).

In her A History of English Food, Clarissa Dickson Wright describes the pudding as requiring "considerable flair to make", as the cook needs to scratch the lemon "so that its flavours burst out while it is being cooked." She notes also that the Sussex shopkeeper Thomas Turner recorded in his diary of the 1750s and 1760s that he ate variants such as currant pond pudding and plum suet pudding.

Passage:
David Vanian
Dave Vanian (born David Lett, 12 October 1956) is a rock musician and lead singer of the punk rock band The Damned. Formed in 1976 in London, The Damned were the first British punk band to release a single, an album, have a record hit the UK charts, and tour the United States. With a fluid line-up since their founding, Vanian has been the only ever-present member.

Career

Born in Hemel Hempstead, Vanian changed his name from Lett to Vanian in early life after a previous stint as a gravedigger – Vanian being a play on "Transylvanian". He remains one of the early influencers of gothic fashion, wearing dark and otherworldly clothing both on stage and off. He is known to be a fan of renaissance art, film noir and horror movies, all of which manifest in his stage appearance. In November 1976, the British music magazine NME stated that Vanian "resembles a runaway from the Addams Family". 

In 1978, he was guest in the song "Don't Panic England", from the band Doctors of Madness. In 2004, he and Captain Sensible turned on the Christmas lights in Cambridge, causing some controversy. 

Vanian sang with the MC5 for their 40th anniversary singing "Looking at You", which was released as part of Revolution: A Celebration of the MC5. In 2008, with the band the Throb, played "Let's Get Lost (Sailor Jerry's Story)" to the compilation The Original Sailor Jerry Rum – Music To ........... To. Outside of the Damned he has led the rockabilly band David Vanian & the Phantom Chords, hosted Dave Vanian's Dark Screen on the UK-based television channel Rockworld TV and composed the soundtrack for the 2009 film, The Perfect Sleep. 

Personal life

Vanian has kept his personal life out of the limelight, even opting out of any input towards The Damned biography The Light at the End of the Tunnel by Carol Clerk. He married his first wife Laurie in 1977, the year after he joined The Damned, but they separated in the mid-1990s. 

He married Patricia Morrison in Las Vegas in 1996, after The Damned had performed an Australian tour. The couple have one child.

If you 'like' us, we'll LOVE you!
You think you know, but you have NO IDEA.
Yes, Frozen came out back in November and we are still talking about it, because it's become one of our favorite movies ever ! Breaking the box office record of the sixth highest-grossing movie of all time is just one of this Disney giant's many accolades.
"Let It Go" remains on repeat during our morning commute and we're still pretty upset that talking snowmen don't actually exist. After breaking all kinds of movie and song records, Frozen the musical is up next!
Before Anna and Elsa hit Broadway, here are 20 things you don't know about this Academy Award-winning movie:

Rapunzel and Flynn Rider from Tangled make a surprise appearance in Frozen! When they open the city gates for Elsa's coronation, you can see the couple's backs toward the camera.

However, there are more Disney theories within the movie. Fans believe that when Elsa and Anna's parents left the kingdom, they were en route to Germany for Rapunzel's homecoming when their ship sank near Denmark. The second part of the theory is that the boat the parents were on is actually the sunken ship in The Little Mermaid. Where does The Little Mermaid take place? Denmark, of course. Disney can be so clever with their inter-weaving storylines.

Queen Elsa was originally supposed to be a villain. Thankfully they changed the story to make her misunderstood. The movie just wouldn't have been the same.

Passage:
Peter Dean (actor)
Peter Dean (born 2 May 1939) is a British actor, most notable for his role as Pete Beale in the BBC soap opera EastEnders.

Career

Dean decided on a career in acting after actress Prunella Scales witnessed him rehearsing Shakespeare in Petticoat Lane Market and advised him to take drama classes.  At 16, he studied under Joan Littlewood and has been an actor since he was 18. 

Dean's breakthrough performance was playing criminal 'Jack Lynn' in Law And Order (1978). He went on to have roles in television shows such as Minder (1979); Up Pompeii! (1971), Doctor Who (1977); Shoestring (1979); Hammer House of Horror (1980) and The Chinese Detective (1981). In 1980, he played Jeff "Fangio" Bateman in Coronation Street and, in 1983, he was cast as Sergeant Jack Wilding in Woodentop  (the Pilot of ITV police drama The Bill).

Film credits include: Up Pompeii (1971), Murder by Decree (1979), Sweet William (1980), The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu (1980), P'tang, Yang, Kipperbang (1982), and as a bouncer in The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle (1980).

At the invitation of producer Julia Smith, he was offered the role of Pete Beale, an original character in the BBC's new soap opera EastEnders; Dean was chosen after the actor who originally auditioned for the role (Leslie Grantham) was selected to play the character Den Watts instead. Dean played the cockney fruit and veg trader from the show's inception in February 1985 until his departure in May 1993. In reality, Dean's contract was terminated following irreconcilable differences with the show's producers. Since his departure, he has publicly slammed the producers for culling his character and did an exposé with the Sun newspaper, where he revealed some of the show's secrets and his opinions about former co-stars.  Subsequently, Pete Beale was killed in an off-screen death in episodes that aired in December 1993. Co-star June Brown (who plays Dot Cotton in the show) allegedly quit the show in protest following Dean's sacking in 1993, but returned in 1997. Brown and Dean attempted to set up a production company together, but it did not come to fruition. 

Since leaving EastEnders, Dean's television credits have been few, although he has made guest appearances on Channel 4 sketch show Bo' Selecta!, Banzai and Little Britain. He appeared in the Five television show Harry and Cosh in 2002 and regularly appears in pantomimes. In 1993 he was due to tour in the play Entertaining Mr Sloane with Barbara Windsor but left during rehearsals and was replaced by John Challis. Dean will be appearing in pantomime in December 2015 as the evil Abanazar in Aladdin at Harpenden Public Halls. 

Personal life

Born in Hoxton, East London, Dean was an acquaintance of the Kray twins while he was growing up. He went to primary school in Holloway and technical school at King’s Cross, where he learnt plumbing and bricklaying. He started drama lessons at 14 when his grandmother, the music hall artist Lilly Randall, realised that he was dyslexic. As a boy, Dean worked on a fruit and veg stall in Chapel Market in North London.

He has been married twice. His first marriage, which ended after three years, produced one daughter, Leah. He met his second wife, Jean, when he was 29 and she was 15; she was babysitting for a mutual acquaintance. Dean is divorced and lives in Wood Green, North London.

Dean is a practising Buddhist. This is the reason why he was always seen drinking from a pewter tankard in EastEnders, because he does not drink beer and would only drink lemonade. He also races greyhounds, although after a recent appearance on the BBC's [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03lv3dn Pointless Celebrities], there have been questions about how ethical his disposal of his retiring dogs might be.
Question:
Which character was once played by Peter Dean in Eastenders?
Answer:
Pete Beale
Passage:
Mount Arafat
Mount Arafat or Mount Arafah ( transliterated Jabal ‘Arafāt) is a granite hill east of Mecca in the plain of Arafat. Arafat is a plain about 20 km southeast of Mecca.  Mount Arafat reaches about 70 m in height and is also known as the Mount of Mercy (Jabal ar-Rahmah). According to Islamic tradition, the hill is the place where the Islamic prophet Muhammad stood and delivered the Farewell Sermon to the Muslims who had accompanied him for the Hajj towards the end of his life.

On the 9th of the month of Dhu al-Hijjah pilgrims go to Arafat from Mina, for the most important part of the Hajj. The Khutbah of Hajj is narrated and Zuhr prayer and Asr prayer are prayed together. The pilgrims spend the whole day on the mountain to supplicate to Allah to forgive their sins and to pray for personal strength in the future.

Hajj 

Arafah rituals end at sunset and pilgrims then move to Muzdalifah for a shortened Maghrib Prayer and Isha prayer and for a short rest.

The level area surrounding the hill is called the Plain of Arafat. The term Mount Arafah is sometimes applied to this entire area. It is an important place in Islam because during the Hajj, pilgrims spend the afternoon there on the ninth day of Dhul Hijjah (ذو الحجة). Failure to be present in the plain of Arafat on the required day invalidates the pilgrimage.

Since late 2010, this place is served by Mecca Metro. On a normal Hajj, it would be around 13 mi to walk.

In literature 

The hill is also referenced in James Joyce's novel Finnegans Wake.
Question:
Mashair Railway that opened in 2010 connecting the sites of Mina, Muzdalifah and Mount Arafat serves the visitors of what city?
Answer:
Mecca (metro)

Etymology for “Mc‑” and “O’‑” prefix in surnames

There is clearly a prefix in names like McDonald, McChrystal, O’Brian, O’Neal.
What does this Mc- and O- prefix signify? It looks like Donald, Chrystal, Brian, Neal are perfectly fine names on their own, so why is there a prefix before it?
  
 
You forgot to mention another prefix for names, that is "Fitz" as in Fitzgerald. It also means "son of" and it clearly shows noble French Norman ancestry. –  Paola Sep 14 '12 at 19:54

@Paola: "fitz" can be derived from Norman French, true, but that does not mean someone with a surname in Fitz- necessarily has Norman, French, or noble ancestry. –  Marthaª Nov 1 '12 at 13:21
  
 
@Marthaª Fitz was used for bastard-names, so FitzRoy was a natural son of the king .  There are also various sorts of FitzWhatevers, like FitzWilliam or FitzCharles or FitzClarence — all originally “illegitimate” children, but sometimes not forever staying that way. –  tchrist♦ Dec 7 '14 at 23:56
The standard way to form a name using a simple patronymic byname for men is:
    <single given name> mac <father's given name (in genitive case & sometimes lenited)>
which means
    <given name> son <of father's given name>
For example, Donnchadh who is the son of Fearchar mac Domhnaill would be:
    Donnchadh mac Fearchair
The standard way to form a name using an Irish clan affiliation byname for men is:
    <single given name> Ó <eponymous clan ancestor's name (in genitive case)>
which means
  <given name> male descendant <of eponymous clan ancestor>
For example, Donnchadh who is the son of Fearchar Ó Conchobhair would be:
    Donnchadh Ó Conchobhair
which means
    Donnchadh male descendant of Conchobhar
Two common misconceptions are (1) that Mac means "son of" — it actually means just "son", and the "of" comes from putting the father's name into the possessive case; and (2) that Mc is Irish while Mac is Scottish (or vice versa) — actually, Mc and Mac are two ways to write the same thing, and both occur in names from both countries. (What is true is that O' is almost exclusively Irish; despite the romantic notions we have of Scottish clans, they didn't use their clan affiliation in their names.)
Edit: as for why the prefix is used even though the prefix-less names look perfectly fine on their own, this is basically Gaelic grammar and thus out of scope for this site. Suffice it to say, some languages are fine with unmarked patronymics — names that identify the bearer's father using the unmodified given name — but Gaelic is not one of them.

I found the following quote which could be helpful. It is from David Booth's (1766-1846) book: An Analytical Dictionary of the English Language.
"Words in ITE very generally denote one of a tribe or nation, and as such may be taken substantively, and have the plural. The Old Testament is full of such denominations, such as the Hittites, the Midianites, &c. Like the ides of Homer, they bore the name of their ancestor. The Israelites were the children of Israel, as the Danaides were of Danaus ; in the same manner as the MAC (son) of the Irish, refers to the father of the tribe, to whose name the syllable is prefixed. Such PATRONYMICS (father-names), as they are called, exist among all nations."
