The Flumps
The Flumps is a children's programme, created and written by Julie Holder, and produced for the BBC by David Yates. It was broadcast by the BBC many times from 1977 to 1988.

Overview

The plot revolved around the various adventures of a family of furry characters called The Flumps. It was created and written by Julie Holder and narrated by Gay Soper. The theme tune was played by George Chisholm on the trombone.

In 1978, the BBC released a record, The Flumps (REC 309), that had 4 stories from the TV series narrated and sung by Gay Soper: "Keep Fit", "Balloons", "Moon Shot" and "Something Different".

In 2000, The Flumps was released on DVD. During early 2008, the theme tune was used in a series of adverts for Auto Trader magazine in the UK. These adverts were run again in Q3 2009.

Characters

The various flumps were:
*Grandpa Flump, who played a Flumpet (a type of trumpet),
*Father Flump, a keen gardener
*Mother Flump, often seen cooking in the kitchen

Passage:
Maghreb cuisine
The Maghreb, the northernmost part of Africa along the Mediterranean Sea  is composed of the countries of Algeria, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia. The region has a high degree of geographic, political, social, economic and cultural diversity which influences the region's cuisine and the culinary style.

Common foods and dishes

In North African cuisine, the most common staple foods are wheat, fish, seafood, goat,  lamb, beef, dates, almonds, olives and various vegetables and fruits. Because the region is predominantly Muslim, halal meats are usually eaten. Most dishes are spiced,  especially with cumin,  ginger, paprika, cinnamon and saffron. Fresh peppermint, parsley, or coriander are also very common. Spice mixtures such as ras el hanout, baharat, and chili pastes like harissa (especially in Tunisia) are frequently used. The use of Legumes, nuts, fruits and spices is very prominent.

The best-known North African dish abroad is surely Couscous, made from wheat. The Tajine, a cooking vessel made of clay of Berber origin, is also a common denominator in this region, although what each nation defines as the resulting dish from being cooked in a tajine as well as the associated preparation methods, may be drastically different. For example, a "tajine" in Tunisia is a baked frittata/quiche-like dish, whereas in Morocco it is dish is a slow-cooked stew. The dishes made in the tajine are dishes like the Marqa or albundigas. Pastilla is also an important Arab-Andalusian dish of North-Africa.

Maghreb cuisine

The cuisine of the Maghreb, the western region of North Africa that includes the five countries of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Mauritania, is a mix of Mediterranean, Arab, Andalusian, Phoenician and Berber dishes. The eastern part of North Africa (Libya and Egypt) is heavily influenced by Arab and Ottoman Empire, sharing characteristics and similar dishes with much of Ottoman. They are also heavily influenced by many Middle-Eastern dishes like the Falafel. The cuisines of Algeria and Tunisia  deriving more influence from French and Italian cuisine respectively and with roots for Tunisia, While Moroccan cuisine is influenced by the Arab and Andalusian cuisine. The Moroccan cuisine itself have roots dating back to the heyday of the kingdom of Numidia modern-day Algeria and kingdom of Mauretania modern-day Morocco.

Cuisine similarities

Most of the North African countries have several similar dishes, sometimes almost the same dish with a different name (the Tunisian coucha and the Moroccan tangia are both essentially the same dish: a meat stew prepared in an urn and cooked overnight in a public oven), sometimes with a slight change in ingredients and cooking style. Additionally, two entirely different dishes may share the same name. There are noticeable differences between the cooking styles of different regions – there are spicy dishes and sophisticated pastries typical of Tunisian cuisine, full-bodied dishes prepared in Moroccan palace cookery, and simpler dishes prepared in various regions and countries.

By country

For more specific styles, refer to the articles on each national or regional cuisine:

*  Tunisian cuisine
*  Algerian cuisine
*  Libyan cuisine
*  Moroccan cuisine
*  Mauritanian cuisine
*  Western Saharan cuisine
Question:
Which North African dish consists of semolina granules cooked by steaming?
Answer:
Berkoukes
Passage:
Right angle
In geometry and trigonometry, a right angle is an angle that bisects the angle formed by two adjacent parts of a straight line. More precisely, if a ray is placed so that its endpoint is on a line and the adjacent angles are equal, then they are right angles.  As a rotation, a right angle corresponds to a quarter turn (that is, a quarter of a full circle). 

Closely related and important geometrical concepts are perpendicular lines, meaning lines that form right angles at their point of intersection, and orthogonality, which is the property of forming right angles, usually applied to vectors. The presence of a right angle in a triangle is the defining factor for right triangles,  making the right angle basic to trigonometry.

The term is a calque of Latin angulus rectus; here rectus means "upright", referring to the vertical perpendicular to a horizontal base line.

Symbols 

In Unicode, the symbol for a right angle is . It should not be confused with the similarly shaped symbol . Related symbols are , , and . 

In diagrams, the fact that an angle is a right angle is usually expressed by adding a small right angle that forms a square with the angle in the diagram, as seen in the diagram of a right triangle (in British English, a right-angled triangle) to the right. The symbol for a measured angle, an arc, with a dot, is used in some European countries, including German-speaking countries and Poland, as an alternative symbol for a right angle. 

Euclid 

Right angles are fundamental in Euclid's Elements. They are defined in Book 1, definition 10, which also defines perpendicular lines. Euclid uses right angles in definitions 11 and 12 to define acute angles (those smaller than a right angle) and obtuse angles (those greater than a right angle).  Two angles are called complementary if their sum is a right angle. 

Book 1 Postulate 4 states that all right angles are equal, which allows Euclid to use a right angle as a unit to measure other angles with. Euclid's commentator Proclus gave a proof of this postulate using the previous postulates, but it may be argued that this proof makes use of some hidden assumptions. Saccheri gave a proof as well but using a more explicit assumption. In Hilbert's axiomatization of geometry this statement is given as a theorem, but only after much groundwork. One may argue that, even if postulate 4 can be proven from the preceding ones, in the order that Euclid presents his material it is necessary to include it since without it postulate 5, which uses the right angle as a unit of measure, makes no sense. 

Conversion to other units 

A right angle may be expressed in different units:
* turn.
*90° (degrees)
* radians
*100 grad (also called grade, gradian, or gon)
*8 points (of a 32-point compass rose)
*6 hours (astronomical hour angle)

Rule of 3-4-5 

Throughout history carpenters and masons have known a quick way to confirm if an angle is a true "right angle."  It is based on the most widely known Pythagorean triple (3, 4, 5) and so called the "Rule of 3-4-5."  From the angle in question, running a straight line along one side exactly three units in length, and along the second side exactly four units in length, will create a hypotenuse (the longer line opposite the right angle that connects the two measured endpoints) of exactly 5 units in length.  This measurement can be made quickly and without technical instruments.  The geometric law behind the measurement is the Pythagorean theorem ("The square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the two adjacent sides").

Thales' theorem 

Thales' theorem states that an angle inscribed in a semicircle (with a vertex on the semicircle and its defining rays going through the endpoints of the semicircle) is a right angle.

Two application examples in which the right angle and the Thales' theorem are included (see animations).
Question:
The area of a right-angled isosceles triangle whose two short sides are 4cms each is how many square cms?
Answer:
8
Passage:
Cynthia Payne
Cynthia Payne (24 December 1932 – 15 November 2015) was an English brothel keeper  and party hostess who made the headlines in the 1970s and 1980s, when she was acquitted of running a brothel at 32 Ambleside Avenue, in Streatham, a southwestern suburb of London.  

Payne first came to national attention in 1978 when police raided her home and found a sex party was in progress. Men paid with luncheon vouchers to dress up in lingerie and be spanked by young women.  Police found 53 men at her residence, in varying levels of undress, which included "a peer of the realm, an MP, a number of solicitors and company directors and several vicars". A cartoon in the press at the time, according to Sarah Baxter in The Sunday Times, "showed a vicar in bed with a prostitute, confronted by a policeman. 'I demand to see my solicitor,' said the vicar, 'who is in the next bedroom.'"  When the case came to trial in 1980, she was sentenced to eighteen months in prison, reduced to a fine and six months on appeal.  She served four months in Holloway prison.

In 1986, the police raided her home again, this time during a "special party" she was hosting after shooting of the film of her life had been completed. Although she was acquitted on this occasion, the resulting court case in 1987 made headlines for several weeks with lurid tales, some details of which she aired on The Dame Edna Experience in 1987, with co-guests Sir John Mills and Rudolf Nureyev, on which she also launched her book, Entertaining at Home. The court case ended her career as a party giver.

On the programme, she expressed an interest in becoming a Member of Parliament in order to change Britain's sex laws, which she followed through by standing for Parliament as a candidate for the Payne and Pleasure Party in the Kensington by-election in July 1988, followed by her standing in her own area of Streatham for the Rainbow Dream Ticket in the 1992 UK General Election. She did not gain a parliamentary seat.

There are two films that are loosely based on her life, both released in 1987: Wish You Were Here, about her adolescence, with Emily Lloyd in the lead role, and Personal Services, about her adult life, starring Julie Walters. Both were written (and Wish You Were Here was directed) by David Leland. 

Payne made appearances as an after-dinner speaker and launched a range of "adult" services and products in 2006.

Payne died on 15 November 2015, aged 82.  Her family celebrated her life a month later with a colourful humanist funeral, in accordance with her wishes.

Passage:
Lonesome George
Lonesome George (c. 1910 – June 24, 2012) was a male Pinta Island tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra abingdonii) and the last known individual of the subspecies.     In his last years, he was known as the rarest creature in the world. George serves as a potent symbol for conservation efforts in the Galápagos Islands and throughout the world. 

Discovery

George was first seen on the island of Pinta on 1 November 1971 by Hungarian malacologist József Vágvölgyi. The island's vegetation had been devastated by introduced feral goats, and the indigenous C. n. abingdonii population had been reduced to a single individual. It is thought that he was named after a character played by American actor George Gobel.  Relocated for his safety to the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island, it was hoped that more Pinta tortoises would be found, either on Pinta or in one of the world’s zoos, similar to the discovery of the Española male in San Diego. George was then penned with two females of a different subspecies. Although eggs were produced, none hatched. Unfortunately, no other Pinta tortoises were found. The Pinta tortoise was pronounced functionally extinct as George was in captivity.

Mating attempts

Over the decades, all attempts at mating Lonesome George had been unsuccessful, due to the lack of females of his own subspecies. This prompted researchers at the Darwin Station to offer a $10,000 reward for a suitable mate.

Until January 2011, George was penned with two females of the subspecies Chelonoidis nigra becki (from the Wolf Volcano region of Isabela Island), in the hope his genotype would be retained in any resulting progeny. This subspecies was then thought to be genetically closest to George's; however, any potential offspring would have been intergrades, not purebreds of the Pinta subspecies. 

In July 2008, George mated with one of his female companions. Thirteen eggs were collected and placed in incubators.  On 11 November 2008, the Charles Darwin Foundation reported 80% of the eggs showed weight loss characteristic of being inviable.  By December 2008, the remaining eggs had failed to hatch and x-rays showed they were inviable. 

On 23 July 2009, exactly one year after announcing George had mated, the Galápagos National Park announced one of George's female companions had laid a second clutch of five eggs.  The park authority expressed its hope for the second clutch of eggs, which it said were in perfect condition.  The eggs were moved to an incubator, but on 16 December, it was announced the incubation period had ended and the eggs were inviable (as was a third batch of six eggs laid by the other female). 

In November 1999, scientists reported Lonesome George was "very closely related to tortoises" from Española Island (C. n. hoodensis) and San Cristóbal Island (C. n. chathamensis).  On 20 January 2011, two individual C. n. hoodensis female partners were imported to the Charles Darwin Research Station, where George lived. 

Death

 
On 24 June 2012, at 8:00 am local time, Edwin Naula, Director of the Galápagos National Park, announced that Lonesome George had been found dead by his caretaker of 40 years, Fausto Llerena.     Naula suspects that the cause of death was heart failure consistent with the end of the natural life cycle of a tortoise. A necropsy confirmed that he died of "old age".  The body of Lonesome George was frozen and shipped to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City to be preserved by taxidermists.  The preservation work was carried out by the museum's taxidermist George Dante, with input from scientists. 

After a short display at the museum, it was expected that Lonesome George would be returned to the Galápagos and will be displayed at the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island for future generations to see.  However, a dispute has broken out between an Ecuadorean ministry and the Galapagos Islands over where the preserved body of a Galapagos giant tortoise should be housed. The Ecuadorean government wants him to be shown in the capital Quito but the Galapagos local mayor says Lonesome George was a symbol of the islands and should return home. 
Most sources state Lonesome George was more than 100 years old,  though others such as David Attenborough said he was probably in his eighties or possibly even younger.  Even one hundred is not especially old for a Galápagos tortoise.

Biological conservation

In November 2012, in the journal Biological Conservation, researchers reported identifying 17 tortoises that are partially descended from the same subspecies as Lonesome George, leading them to speculate that related purebred individuals of that subspecies may still be alive. 

In December 2015 it was reported that the discovery of another species (Chelonoidis donfaustoi) by Yale researchers had a 90% DNA match to that of the Pinta tortoise and that scientists believe this could possibly be used to resurrect the species.
Question:
What type of creature was Lonesome George, who died in 2012 and who gained fame as the rarest creature in the world? (hint: he was aged perhaps more than 100 years)
Answer:
Pinta Island Giant Tortoise
Passage:
Glenridding
Glenridding is a village located at the southern end of Ullswater, in the English Lake District. The village is popular with mountain walkers who can scale England's third highest mountain, Helvellyn, and many other challenging peaks from here. The village has accommodation including two Youth Hostels and camping sites. Glenridding House provides luxury Bed and Breakfast accommodation. There is also a tourist information centre, Ullswater Information Centre. 

Glenridding is in the civil parish of Patterdale.

Each year, on Easter Monday, a duck race is organised by the local mountain rescue team to raise funds.

On 6 December 2015, Storm Desmond caused extensive and devastating flooding to the village, with torrential rainfall and rivers bursting their banks. Four days later, more rainfall caused rivers to burst their banks once again, leading to even more flood damage to businesses and homes in the village.   

Greenside Mine

Above the village is the site of the former Greenside Mine, which was once the largest lead mine in the Lake District. Lead ore was discovered in the 18th century and the site was mined from the second half of the 18th century until the mine closed in 1962. Without the mine, the houses and economy of Glenridding and the surrounding area would not have existed. 

Ullswater Steamers

Glenridding is home to the Ullswater 'Steamers', a leisure boat trip company which operates five vessels from the pier at Glenridding. The company was originally founded to provide a transport link for goods from Glenridding to Pooley Bridge and onwards to Penrith.

Glenridding in popular culture

The village and surrounding area was used to film the TV series The Lakes.
Question:
Glenridding and Pooley Bridge stand at opposite ends of which lake in the Lake District

Published on Nov 17, 2012
The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system composed of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands stretching for over 2,600 kilometres (1,600 mi) over an area of approximately 344,400 square kilometres (133,000 sq mi). The reef is located in the Coral Sea, off the coast of Queensland, Australia.
The Great Barrier Reef can be seen from outer space and is the world's biggest single structure made by living organisms.  This reef structure is composed of and built by billions of tiny organisms, known as coral polyps. It supports a wide diversity of life and was selected as a World Heritage Site in 1981. CNN labeled it one of the seven natural wonders of the world. The Queensland National Trust named it a state icon of Queensland.
A large part of the reef is protected by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which helps to limit the impact of human use, such as fishing and tourism. Other environmental pressures on the reef and its ecosystem include runoff, climate change accompanied by mass coral bleaching, and cyclic population outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish. According to a study published on 1 October 2012 by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the reef has lost more than half its coral cover since 1985.
The Great Barrier Reef has long been known to and used by the Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and is an important part of local groups' cultures and spirituality. The reef is a very popular destination for tourists, especially in the Whitsunday Islands and Cairns regions. Tourism is an important economic activity for the region, generating $1 billion per year.

Passage:
Muslim
A Muslim (sometimes spelled Moslem;  historically called a Muhammadan in non-Islamic Anglophone societies) is a person who follows or practises the religion of Islam,  a monotheistic and Abrahamic religion based on the Quran. Muslims consider the Quran to be the verbatim word of God as revealed to the Islamic prophet and messenger Muhammad. They also follow the sunnah teachings and practices of Muhammad as recorded in traditional accounts called hadith.  "Muslim" is an Arabic word meaning "one who submits (to God)".  A female Muslim is sometimes called a Muslimah.  There are customs holding that a man and woman or teenager and adolescent above the age of fifteen of a lunar or solar calendar who possesses the faculties of rationality, logic or sanity, but misses numerous successive Jumu'ahs without a valid excuse, no longer qualifies as a Muslim.  

Most Muslims will accept anyone who has publicly pronounced the declaration of faith (shahadah) as a Muslim. The shahadah states:

The testimony authorized by God in the Quran can found in Surah 3:18 states. 

"There is no god except God", which in Arabic (La Ilaha Ila Allah), is the exact testimony which God Himself utters, also the angels and those who possess knowledge utter. 

Islamic belief commonly held by Muslims include: that God ( Allāh|) is eternal, transcendent and absolutely one (monotheism); that God is incomparable, self-sustaining and neither begets nor was begotten; that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that has been revealed before through many prophets including Abraham, Moses, Ishmael and Jesus; that these previous messages and revelations have been partially changed or corrupted over time and that the Qur'an is the final unaltered revelation from God (The Final Testament). 

The religious practices of Muslims are enumerated in the Five Pillars of Islam, which, in addition to Shahadah, consist of daily prayers (salat), fasting during the Islamic month of Ramadan (sawm), almsgiving (zakat), and the pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj) at least once in a lifetime.

Lexicology

The word muslim (,;,, or moslem,) is the participle of the same verb of which islām is the infinitive, based on the triliteral S-L-M "to be whole, intact".   It is a liturgical phonology that is formed from two components; the pronoun prefix "mu" and the triconsonantal root "slim".  A female adherent is a muslima (). The plural form in Arabic is muslimūn () or muslimīn (), and its feminine equivalent is muslimāt (). The Arabic form muslimun is the stem IV participle  of the triliteral S-L-M.  A female Muslim can variously be called in their etymologically Arabic form of Muslimah, also spelled Muslima, Muslimette, Muslimess or simple the standard term of Muslim.   General alternative epithets or designations given to Muslims include mosquegoer, masjidgoer, or archaic, dated and obsolete terms such as Muslimite or Muslimist.   

The ordinary word in English is "Muslim". It is sometimes transliterated as "Moslem", which is an older spelling.  The word Mosalman (, alternatively Mussalman) is a common equivalent for Muslim used in Central Asia. Until at least the mid-1960s, many English-language writers used the term Mohammedans or Mahometans.  Although such terms were not necessarily intended to be pejorative, Muslims argue that the terms are offensive because they allegedly imply that Muslims worship Muhammad rather than God. 

Meaning

In defining Muslim, the Muslim philosopher Ibn Arabi said:

Used to describe earlier prophets in the Qur'an

The Qur'an describes many prophets and messengers as well as their respective followers as Muslim: Adam, Noah, Abraham, Jacob, Moses and Jesus and his apostles are all considered to be Muslims in the Qur'an. The Qur'an states that these men were Muslims because they submitted to God, preached His message and upheld His values, which included praying, charity, fasting and pilgrimage. Thus, in Surah 3:52 of the Qur'an, Jesus' disciples tell Jesus, "We believe in God; and you be our witness that we are Muslims (wa-shahad be anna muslimūn)." In Muslim belief, before the Qur'an, God had given the Torah to Moses, the Psalms to David and the Gospel to Jesus, who are all considered important Muslim prophets.

Demographics

About 13% of Muslims live in Indonesia, the largest Muslim country, 25% in South Asia, 20% in the Middle East and North Africa,  2% in Central Asia, 4% in the remaining South East Asian countries, and 15% in Sub-saharan Africa. Sizable communities are also found in China and Russia, and parts of the Caribbean. The country with the highest proportion of self-described Muslims as a proportion of its total population is Morocco.  Converts and immigrant communities are found in almost every part of the world.

The majority of Muslims are Sunni, being over 75–90% of all Muslims. The second and third largest sects, Shia and Ahmadiyya, make up 10–20%, and 1% respectively.

Passage:
The Harry Potter Lexicon
The Harry Potter Lexicon is a fan-created online encyclopedia of the Harry Potter series.

Overview

The site was created by school librarian Steve Vander Ark. It contains detailed information for all seven published Harry Potter books. The Lexicon lists characters, places, creatures, spells, potions and magical devices, as well as analyzing magical theory and other details of the series. The Lexicon is credited as creating one of the first timelines of all events occurring in the Harry Potter universe. A similar timeline of events was adopted by Warner Bros. for inclusion with their Harry Potter film DVDs, and was accepted by author J. K. Rowling as conforming to her works.

The Lexicon is a winner of J. K. Rowling's Fan Site Award. Rowling said:  

Lawsuit

On October 31, 2007, J.K. Rowling and Warner Brothers filed a lawsuit against RDR Books over the publication of Vander Ark's Lexicon in book form.   The lawsuit was heard in a New York court on April 14, 2008.  Whilst some sources refer to Vander Ark being sued, the lawsuit actually names only RDR Books. 

The lawsuit states, 

The result of the lawsuit was that the book could be published, but not in its present form. A modified version of the book was published in 2009.
This case went to bench trial in the New York Federal District Court of Judge Robert Patterson on April 14, 2008. RDR Books defense team, which includes solo San Francisco practitioner, Lizbeth Hasse of the Creative Industry Law Group, solo New York practitioner David Hammer, and the Fair Use Project at Stanford University Law School, has replied to the suit arguing:

Rowling stated that her efforts to halt the publishing of the Lexicon have been crushing her creativity, and said that she was not sure if she has "the will or the heart" to now publish her own encyclopedia. 

On 8 September 2008, Rowling won her copyright case against RDR Books.  Lexicon publisher RDR Books said:

Judge Patterson said that reference materials were generally useful to the public but that in this case, Vander Ark went too far. He said that "while the Lexicon, in its current state, is not a fair use of the Harry Potter works, reference works that share the Lexicon's purpose of aiding readers of literature generally should be encouraged rather than stifled." He said he ruled in Ms. Rowling's favor because the "Lexicon appropriates too much of Rowling's creative work for its purposes as a reference guide."

Publication

In December, 2008, a modified (and shorter) version of Vander Ark's Lexicon was approved for publication and was released January 16, 2009 as The Lexicon: An Unauthorized Guide to Harry Potter Fiction.
Question:
Legal action by J K Rowling and Warner Brothers commenced in 2007 against which company for its plans to publish a Harry Potter Lexicon?
Answer:
RDR Books
Passage:
Aquae Sulis
For the Roman Baths complex at Aquae Sulis, see Roman Baths (Bath).
Aquae Sulis was a small town in the Roman province of Britannia. Today it is the English city of Bath, Somerset.

Development

Baths and temple complex

The Romans probably began building a formal temple complex at Aquae Sulis in the AD 60s.  The Romans had probably arrived in the area shortly after their arrival in Britain in AD 43 and there is evidence that their military road, the Fosse Way, crossed the river Avon at Bath.  An early Roman military presence has been found just to the North-East of the bath complex in the Walcot area of modern Bath.   Not far from the crossing point of their road, they would have been attracted by the large natural hot spring which had been a shrine of the Celtic Brythons, dedicated to their goddess, Sulis. This spring is a natural mineral spring found in the valley of the Avon River in Southwest England, it is the only spring in Britain officially designated as hot. The name is Latin for "the waters of Sulis." The Romans identified the goddess with their goddess Minerva and encouraged her worship. The similarities between Minerva and Sulis helped the Celts adapt to Roman culture. The spring was built up into a major Roman Baths complex associated with an adjoining temple. About 130 messages to Sulis scratched onto lead curse tablets (defixiones) have been recovered from the Sacred Spring by archaeologists.  Most of them were written in Latin, although one discovered was in Brythonic and usually laid curses upon those whom the writer felt had done them wrong. This collection is the most important found in Britain.

The Brythonic curse recovered on a metal pendant is the only sentence in the language that has been discovered.   It reads:
Adixoui Deuina Deieda Andagin Uindiorix cuamenai or maybe Adixoui Deiana Deieda Andagin Uindiorix cuamiun ai

The affixed – Deuina, Deieda, Andagin, (and) Uindiorix – I have bound 

An alternative translation based on a much better knowledge of the Celtic languages is the following:
May I, Windiorix for/at Cuamena defeat (alt. summon to justice) the worthless woman, oh divine Deieda.  (Alt. Divine Deiada, may I, Windiorix, bring to justice/defeat (in court) the woman at Cuamena.)

This is a superior, though still uncertain, translation in that it takes into account the nominal cases of the nouns:

Windiorix (alt. Windorix) - nominative masculine (subject), lit. "fair-headed" (windo) "king" (rix); Dewina Deieda - nominative/vocative feminine "divine Deieda" (deiada "goddess"); Andagin - accusative feminine "woman"; "Cuamenai - locative/dative feminine of Cuamena

Walled town

It was the religious settlement, rather than the road junction further north, which was given defensive stone walls, probably in the 3rd century. The area within - of approximately 23 acre  - was largely open ground, but soon began to be filled in. There is some dispute as to whether these new buildings were private dwellings or were associated with servicing the pilgrims to the temple. There was also a ribbon development along the northern road outside the walls and cemeteries beyond. 

Decline

From the later 3rd century on, the Western Roman Empire and its urban life declined. However, while the great suite of baths fell into disrepair, some use of the hot springs continued. After the end of Roman rule in Britain around AD 410, some residents seem to have remained, but violence seems to have taken root for, in the 440s, a young girl's severed head was thrust into an oven in Abbeygate Street.[http://www.britannia.com/history/ebk/articles/nenniuscities.html Britannia Articles: Nennius' Twenty-Eight British Cities] As far back as Geoffrey of Monmouth, the Arthurian Battle of Mons Badonicus (c. 500) has been suggested to have taken place near Aquae Sulis.[http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/FeaturesBritain/BritishMountBadon.htm Mount Badon/Mons Badonicus]

Medieval legend

In medieval times, the Roman temple at Bath was incorporated into British legend. The thermal springs at Bath were said to have been dedicated to Minerva by the legendary King Bladud and the temple there endowed with an eternal flame. 

An 8th century poem in Old English, The Ruin, describing the ruinous changes that had overtaken a Roman hot-water spring, is assumed to be a reference to Aquae Sulis. The poem was copied in the Exeter Book for transmission to future generations.

Remains

Rediscovered from the 18th century onward, the city's Roman remains have become one of the city's main attractions. They may be viewed almost exclusively at the Roman Baths Museum, which houses:
*Artefacts recovered from the Baths and the Roman town. There is a fine collection of stone sculptures.
*Excavated remains of the main temple courtyard.
*The Roman Baths themselves, though some lie below 18th century stonework. Of particular note is the original Roman Great Bath still lead lined and fed by the sacred spring through Roman lead pipes.
*A hoard of 30,000 silver coins, one of the largest discovered in Britain, was unearthed in an archaeological dig in 2012. The coins, believed to date from the 3rd century, were found not far away from the Roman baths.
