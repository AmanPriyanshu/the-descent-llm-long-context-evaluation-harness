Gracie Mansion
 
It turns out that not all Manhattanites live in cramped apartments…for example, the mayor of New York City, who lives in Gracie Mansion. This federal-style home was once a country estate, an ice-cream parlor, the first home of the Museum of the City of New York, and most famously, a residence for some of New York's mayors, beginning with Mayor LaGuardia.
 
It sits facing the Hells Gate channel of the East River. After a 2002 renovation, both the interior and exterior were restored, and the house was transformed into the "People's House" with increased accessibility to the public and to city agencies.
 
The mansion has been used to accommodate visiting officials and dignitaries, such as former guests First Lady Rosalynn Carter and President Nelson Mandela.

M606 motorway
The M606 Bradford Spur motorway in England leaves the M62 motorway at junction 26, near Cleckheaton, and heads into Bradford, to join the A6177 Bradford Ring Road. It is officially named the "Bradford South Radial Motorway" and was opened in 1973.

Configuration of the terminal junctions

Staygate

The northern end of the M606, closest to the city, was built with a large raised roundabout crossing the Bradford Ring Road, but the original plans to continue the motorway under the roundabout  were not carried out: access was only by slip roads to and from the roundabout.

In 1999 a new slip road was built that allowed eastward traffic on the ring road, via a mini-roundabout, to enter the motorway directly and avoid the Staygate roundabout. 

In 2004 the junction was further remodelled, so that traffic leaving the motorway and wishing to turn eastward on the ring road continues under the roundabout, and round to join the roundabout from the opposite site, so that it has a left rather than a right turn to make (via two sets of traffic lights). 

Staygate roundabout is very close to Odsal Stadium, the home of the rugby league club Bradford Bulls.

 

Chain Bar

The southerly junction with the M62 is known as the Chain Bar Interchange and features free-flowing sliproads from the Manchester direction M62 traffic to Bradford, but not the Leeds direction, which has to use the traffic-light controlled roundabout.
Since late 2007 there is a 2+ lane leading from the M606 straight on to the M62 without having to stop at Chain Bar Interchange.

List of junctions

Britain's first dedicated motorway carpool lane

In 2007, work started on the M606 to create the UK's first motorway carpool lane (also known as high-occupancy vehicle or HOV lane). The  lane scheme is on the M606 southbound and will allow vehicles with more than one person in the car a fast track onto the M62 eastbound at Junction 26.

Bradford
Passage:
The Edge of Heaven
"The Edge of Heaven" is a song by British pop duo Wham!, released on Epic Records in 1986. It was written by George Michael, one half of the duo, and was promoted in advance as Wham!'s farewell single.

History

With the known desire of George Michael to move into a more adult market, Wham! had announced in the spring of 1986 that Michael and his musical partner Andrew Ridgeley would go their separate ways after a farewell single, album and concert. The album was called "The Final" and the concert was held in front of 72,000 fans at London's Wembley Stadium on Saturday 28 June 1986. 

The single, a five-minute tale of emotional and physical frustration within a relationship, was a slick and upbeat — albeit harder-edged than earlier works — pop tune which became the fourth and final No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart  (and the final US Top Ten hit, reaching #10) for the duo. Elton John, a friend of Michael and Ridgeley, played piano on the track.

Michael has said the lyrics to the song were "deliberately and overtly sexual, especially the first verse".  The reason for this, he says, was he thought no one would care "because no one listens to a Wham! lyric.  It had got to that stage." 

Epic released a double record set in the UK, with an updated version of Wham!'s early signature song "Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)" on the flip of disc one, and two new songs - "Battlestations" and a cover of the Was (Not Was) song "Where Did Your Heart Go?" - on the flip of the second disc. "Where Did Your Heart Go?" was later given an equal billing and reached a lowly position in the UK Top 40 as a result.

In the United States, "The Edge of Heaven" was backed with a live version of "Blue" from Wham!'s tour of China. "Where Did Your Heart Go?" was released separately as the follow-up and the fourth and last single from Music from the Edge of Heaven (the shortened American version of The Final), and charted at #50 (backed with "Wham! Rap '86").

Two months earlier, George Michael had achieved his second solo No. 1 with "A Different Corner" (which also made #7 in the US), and he was back in the charts as a permanent solo artist within six months of "The Edge of Heaven".

Music video

The official music video for the song was directed by Andy Morahan.

Passage:
Patella
The patella, also known as the kneecap or kneepan, is a thick, circular-triangular bone which articulates with the femur (thigh bone) and covers and protects the anterior articular surface of the knee joint. The patella is found in many tetrapods, such as  mice, cats, and birds, but not in whales or most reptiles and amphibians such as snakes or frogs.

In humans, the patella is the largest sesamoid bone in the body. Babies are born with a patella of soft cartilage which begins to ossify into bone at about three years of age.
Structure 

The patella is a sesamoid bone roughly triangular in shape, with the apex of the patella facing downwards.The apex is the most inferior (lowest) part of the patella. It is pointed in shape, and gives attachment to the patellar ligament.

The front and back surfaces are joined by a thin margin and towards centre by a thicker margin. The tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle attaches to the base of the patella., with the vastus intermedius muscle attaching to the base itself, and the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis are attached to outer lateral and medial borders of patella respectively.

The upper third of the front of the patella is coarse, flattened, and rough, and serves for the attachment of the tendon of the quadriceps and often has exostoses. The middle third has numerous vascular canaliculi. The lower third culminates in the apex which serves as the origin of the patellar ligament. The posterior surface is divided into two parts.

Patella ant.jpg|Human left patella from the front
Patella post.jpg|Human left patella from behind

The upper three-quarters of the patella articulates with the femur and is subdivided into a medial and a lateral facet by a vertical ledge which varies in shape.

In the adult the articular surface is about 12 cm2 and covered by cartilage, which can reach a maximal thickness of 6 mm in the centre at about 30 years of age.

The lower part of the posterior surface has vascular canaliculi filled and is filled by fatty tissue, the infrapatellar fat pad.

Variation

Emarginations (i.e. patella emarginata, a "missing piece") are common laterally on the proximal edge. Bipartite patellas are the result of an ossification of a second cartilaginous layer at the location of an emargination.  Previously, bipartite patellas were explained as the failure of several ossification centres to fuse, but this idea has been rejected. Partite patellas occur almost exclusively in men.  Tripartite and even multipartite patellas occur.

The upper three-quarters of the patella articulates with the femur and is subdivided into a medial and a lateral facet by a vertical ledge which varies in shape.  Four main types of articular surface can be distinguished:
# Most commonly the medial articular surface is smaller than the lateral.
# Sometimes both articular surfaces are virtually equal in size.
# Occasionally, the medial surface is hypoplastic or
# the central ledge is only indicated.

Development

In the patella an ossification centre develops between the ages 3–6 years. The patella originates from two centres of ossification which unite when fully formed.

Function 

The primary functional role of the patella is knee extension. The patella increases the leverage that the tendon can exert on the femur by increasing the angle at which it acts.

It is attached to the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle, which contracts to extend/straighten the knee. The patella is stabilized by the insertion of the horizontal fibres of vastus medialis and by the prominence of the lateral femoral condyle, which discourages lateral dislocation during flexion. The retinacular fibres of the patella also stabilize it during exercise.

Clinical significance

Dislocation

Patellar dislocations occur with significant regularity, particular in young female athletes. It involves the patella sliding out of its position on the knee, most often laterally, and may be associated with extremely intense pain and swelling. The patella can be tracked back into the groove with an extension of the leg, and therefore sometimes returns into the proper position on its own.

Fracture

The kneecap is prone to injury because of its particularly exposed location, and fractures of the patella commonly occur as a consequence of direct trauma onto the knee. These fractures usually cause swelling and pain in the region, bleeding into the joint (hemarthrosis), and an inability to extend the knee. Patella fractures are usually treated with surgery, unless the damage is minimum and the extensor mechanism is intact.

Exostosis

An exostosis is the formation of new bone onto a bone, as a result of excess calcium formation. This can be the cause of chronic pain when formed on the patella.

Other animals

The patella has convergently evolved in placental mammals and birds; most marsupials have only rudimentary, non-ossified patellae although a few species possess a bony patella.  A patella is also present in the living monotremes, the platypus and the echidna. In more primitive tetrapods, including living amphibians and most reptiles (except some Lepidosaurs), the muscle tendons from the upper leg are attached directly to the tibia, and a patella is not present.

History

The etymology of patella presents a case of convergent etymology.  In the Western world, 'patella' originated in the late 17th century from the diminutive form of Latin ', meaning shallow dish.   The use of this term in Eastern medicine, however, predates the Western etymology.  As early as the 13th century, traditional Ayurveda practitioners in the Indian subcontinent referred to the kneecap as paṭēla haḍḍī (), literally 'farmer's bone' because the grueling life of a patidar.  The term was subsequently shortened to just 'patela'. During the British Raj period, Western medicine was introduced to India, and the two etymologies converged into the modern medical use, with two 'L's.

Harold Arlen - Biography - We're Off to See the Wizard
Harold Arlen - Biography - We're Off to See the Wizard
 
WE'RE OFF TO SEE THE WIZARD! - COMPOSING THE SCORE TO          THE WIZARD OF OZ
In          July 1938, Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg were signed by Metro Goldwyn Mayer (M-G-M) to write the score for the filming of the childhood classic The Wizard of Oz. Arthur Freed, associate producer of the film,          pushed for the Arlen-Harburg team to compose the score because he felt          that Harburg's feeling for lyrical fantasy and Arlen's musical fancy together          created the perfect combination for the project.
Once signed, the team began work immediately having only had two months          to turn out what was expected to be a unique and extended film score!          The pressure was on, even for the veteran writer Arlen, who later admitted          that the assignment really troubled him. Once they had completed what          Harold called the "lemon drop" songs, We're Off to See          the Wizard, The Merry Old Land of Oz, Ding-Dong!          The Witch is Dead, Harold felt that a ballad was needed to balance          them out. "I felt we needed something with a sweep, a melody with          a broad, long, line. Time was getting short, I was getting anxious. My          feeling was that picture songs need to be lush, and picture songs are          hard to write."
The song came to Harold literally out of the blue one day while he and          Anya were headed to a movie at Grauman's Chinese Theater. As they were          driving along Sunset Boulevard, the broad, long-lined melody suddenly          came to him. He jotted it down in the car on one of his jotting papers,          which he was known to carry around with him in case struck with an idea.          Of the breakthrough, Harold said, "It was as if the Lord said, 'Well,          here it is, now stop worrying about it!'"
After completing the bridge (the middle section of the song) the next          day, the song was ready for Harburg to hear. Unfortunately, the lyricist          did not react to it with the joy Harold had hoped for. Harburg felt that the song was too grand in proportion for a little girl in Kansas to be          singing and that it might clash the direct simplicity and lightness of          the other songs. Still, Harold defended his hard-won tune and played it          for friend Ira Gershwin to get a second opinion. Gershwin liked it. Harburg,          in response to Gershwin's approval, quickly titled the new song Over          the Rainbow and composed its lyrics.
Judy Garland, who was cast to play the lead role of Dorothy, heard the          song and loved it, but the other ears at M-G-M were not as impressed.          Miss Garland has written, "When I first met Harold I was just 14          years old and the first song of the score for The Wizard of Oz they played for me was Over the Rainbow. I was terribly          impressed by Mr. Arlen's great genius and very much in awe of him. As          I recall, it seems that Harold always treated me as an equal and not as          a child. We have been great friends through the years."
"[As          for] my feeling toward Over the Rainbow now, it has become          a part of my life. It is so symbolic of everybody's dream and wish that          I am sure that's why people sometimes get tears in their eyes when they          hear it. I have sung it dozens of times and it's still the song that is          closest to my heart. It is very gratifying to have a song that is more or less known as my song, or my theme song, and to have had it written          by the fantastic Harold Arlen."
Over the Rainbow was deleted from the print of The Wizard          of Oz three times! After each deletion Arthur Freed would storm into          the front office and argue it back into the film. Further opposition came          from the publisher, who objected to the "difficult-to-sing" octave leap in the melody on the word "some-where," and also          to the simple middle. But Freed and Arlen stood up to the powers-that-be          and the song remained, ironically to later receive the Academy Award as          the best film song of the year!
The Wizard of Oz was completed in 1939 and cost M-G-M some three          million dollars to create. The movie was a huge success when released          that year. Over six decades later, it continues to be a favorite of the          young and old alike. The movie is simply magical as it takes its viewers          from reality to fantasy by transforming the black and white scenes in          Kansas to vivid color upon Dorothy's arrival in Oz. And while the special          effects, grand costumes, lavish scenery and masterful makeup capture the          eye, the songs settle in the hearts and heads of the audience and remain          long after the movie's end.
In          2000, Over the Rainbow was recognized as the Number One          Song of the 20th Century proving that the song that Harold Arlen worked          so hard to keep in the film was truly worth fighting for.
Question:

Passage:
Balance bicycle
A balance bicycle, or run bike is a training bicycle that helps children learn balance and steering.  It has no pedals and no drivetrain.

Designs

Balance bikes have been made out of both metal and wood. It can be a normal bicycle with pedals and related parts removed, or it can be purpose-built (especially for very small children, for whom normal bicycles are generally not available). It can have no brake, or it can have one or two hand-activated rim brakes.

To function properly, a balance bicycle must be small enough that the rider can walk the bicycle while sitting comfortably in the saddle, putting both feet flat on the ground.  The rider first walks the bicycle while standing over the saddle, then while sitting in the saddle.  Eventually, the rider feels comfortable enough to run and "scoot" while riding the bicycle, then to lift both feet off the ground and cruise while balancing on the two wheels.

Learning method

Manufacturers of balance bicycles say that children can learn to bicycle faster because they learn to balance and countersteer first and then to pedal later, and that training wheels slow learning because kids become too dependent on them, acquiring bad habits. Pediatricians  say that there is no evidence that children learn to bike faster without training wheels. Training wheels that prevent the bike from leaning also prevent countersteering, so that, as with a tricycle, kids learn to turn the handlebars the wrong way, which must be unlearned later. Sheldon Brown wrote that training wheels can become an obstacle to learning if they are adjusted incorrectly, because they prevent the bike from leaning if they are too low, and can inhibit braking if too much weight is taken off the rear wheel by training wheels that are too low. Adjusting training wheels correctly, and raising them higher as the child's skill increases, avoids these problems. Balance bikes with no brakes at all except the rider's feet might stop poorly as well, though very young children might not use brakes effectively anyway. Brown recommended simply removing the pedals from a normal kid's bicycle, avoiding the extra expense of a balance bike, and parents have had success with this approach.

History

The first balance bicycle was the dandy horse, and was invented by Karl Drais, the earliest form of a two-wheeler - without pedals. His first reported ride from Mannheim to Rheinau (now a section of Mannheim) took place on June 12, 1817.  Drais was a German inventor and invented the Laufmaschine ("running machine"), also later called the velocipede, draisine (English) or "draisienne" (French), or nicknamed, dandy horse. This incorporated the two-wheeler principle that is basic to the bicycle and motorcycle and meant the beginning of mechanized personal transport.

Horology
Horology (via Latin horologium from Greek , from  hṓra "hour; time" and -o- interfix and suffix -logy; literally "the study of time")   is the art or science of measuring time. Clocks, watches, clockwork, sundials, hourglasses, clepsydras, timers, time recorders, marine chronometers and atomic clocks are all examples of instruments used to measure time.  In current usage, horology refers mainly to the study of mechanical time-keeping devices, while chronometry more broadly includes electronic devices that have largely supplanted mechanical clocks for the best accuracy and precision in time-keeping.

People interested in horology are called horologists. That term is used both by people who deal professionally with timekeeping apparatus (watchmakers, clockmakers), as well as aficionados and scholars of horology.  Horology and horologists have numerous organizations, both professional associations and more scholarly societies.

Museums and libraries 

There are many horology museums and several specialized libraries devoted to the subject. One example is the Royal Greenwich Observatory, which is also the source of the Prime Meridian (longitude 0° 0' 0"), and the home of the first marine timekeepers accurate enough to determine longitude (made by John Harrison). Other horological museums in the London area include the Clockmakers' Museum, which re-opened at the Science Museum in October 2015, and the horological collections at the British Museum, the Science Museum (London) and at the Wallace Collection.

One of the more comprehensive museums dedicated to horology is the Musée international d'horlogerie in La Chaux-de-Fonds (Switzerland). The Musée d'Horlogerie du Locle is smaller but located nearby. One of the better horological museums in Germany is the Deutsches Uhrenmuseum in Furtwangen im Schwarzwald, in the Black Forest. The two leading specialised horological museums in North America are the National Watch and Clock Museum in Columbia, Pennsylvania, and the American Clock and Watch Museum in Bristol, Connecticut.

The eastern French city of Besançon has the Musée du Temps (Museum of Time) in the historic Palais Grenvelle.

An example of a museum devoted to one particular type of clock is the Cuckooland Museum in the U.K., which hosts the world's largest collection of antique cuckoo clocks.

One of the most comprehensive horological libraries open to the public is the National Watch and Clock Library in Columbia, Pennsylvania. Other good horological libraries providing public access are at the Musée international d'horlogerie in Switzerland, at the Deutsches Uhrenmuseum in Germany, and at the Guildhall Library in London.

Another museum dedicated to clocks is the Willard House and Clock Museum in Grafton, Massachusetts.

Organizations 

Notable scholarly horological organizations include:
* American Watchmakers-Clockmakers Institute – AWCI (United States of America)
* Antiquarian Horological Society – AHS (United Kingdom)
* British Horological Institute – BHI (United Kingdom)
* Chronometrophilia (Switzerland)
* Deutsche Gesellschaft für Chronometrie – DGC (Germany)
* National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors – NAWCC (United States of America)

Size: $38 million in 1971; $1.238 billion in revenues for 2012
Elizabeth Arden was not just a leading beauty entrepreneur; she was a pioneering New Woman, suffragist and maverick. Born Florence Nightingale Graham in Canada, she trained and briefly worked as a nurse, where she was inspired by the use of creams to treat burns. She moved to New York in 1909, took a job at salon, and a year later opened her Fifth Avenue spa with what would become her trademark red door and her new name Elizabeth Arden. A staunch advocate for equality, Arden joined 15,000 women in a suffrage demonstration in 1912, with the marchers all donning red lipstick as a sign of fortitude. In 1914, she hired chemists to develop the first of hundreds of skincare products. Arden also mastered new, modern marketing techniques to promote cosmetics – which had previously been associated with prostitutes and other lower status women – to a respectable, upscale market. Her strategy worked. By 1922, Arden’s company became one of the first global brands when she opened a spa in Paris. Her longtime rivalry with Helena Rubenstein further sparked her ambition. Arden’s business not only survived the Great Depression, but in the 1930s was hailed as one of the three best-known American brands in the world (the other two were Coca-Cola and Singer Sewing Machines.) Arden shared the secrets of her success with would-be women entrepreneurs at seminars after World War II and in 1946 was the first woman on the cover of Time magazine. There were over 100 Elizabeth Arden Salons worldwide at the time of her death in 1966; the company was sold in 1971 for $38 million.
“It is remarkable what a woman can accomplish with just a little ambition.”

Passage:
United States Secretary of State
The Secretary of State is a senior official of the federal government of the United States of America heading the U.S. Department of State, principally concerned with foreign policy and is considered to be the U.S. government's equivalent of a Minister for Foreign Affairs.  

The Secretary of State is appointed by the President of the United States and is confirmed by the United States Senate. The Secretary of State, along with the Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Defense, and Attorney General are generally regarded as the four most important cabinet members because of the importance of their respective departments.  Secretary of State is a Level I position in the Executive Schedule and thus earns the salary prescribed for that level.

The current Secretary of State is John Kerry, the 68th person to hold the office since its creation in 1789.

Duties and responsibilities

The specific duties of the Secretary of State include:

*Organizes and supervises the entire United States Department of State and the United States Foreign Service
*Advises the President on matters relating to U.S. foreign policy, including the appointment of diplomatic representatives to other nations, and on the acceptance or dismissal of representatives from other nations
*Participates in high-level negotiations with other countries, either bilaterally or as part of an international conference or organization, or appoints representatives to do so.  This includes the negotiation of international treaties and other agreements
*Responsible for overall direction, coordination, and supervision of interdepartmental activities of the U.S. Government overseas
*Providing information and services to U.S. citizens living or traveling abroad, including providing credentials in the form of passports and visas
*Ensures the protection of the U.S. Government to American citizens, property, and interests in foreign countries
*Supervises the United States immigration policy abroad
*Communicates issues relating the United States foreign policy to Congress and to U.S. citizens

The original duties of the Secretary of State include some domestic duties, such as: 
* Receipt, publication, distribution, and preservation of the laws of the United States
* Preparation, sealing, and recording of the commissions of Presidential appointees
* Preparation and authentication of copies of records and authentication of copies under the Department's seal
* Custody of the Great Seal of the United States
* Custody of the records of the former Secretary of the Continental Congress, except for those of the Treasury and War Departments

Most of the domestic functions of the Department of State have been transferred to other agencies. Those that remain include storage and use of the Great Seal of the United States, performance of protocol functions for the White House, and the drafting of certain proclamations.  The Secretary also negotiates with the individual States over the extradition of fugitives to foreign countries. Under Federal Law,  the resignation of a President or of a Vice-President is only valid if declared in writing, in an instrument delivered to the office of the Secretary of State. Accordingly, the resignations of President Nixon and of Vice-President Spiro Agnew, domestic issues, were formalized in instruments delivered to the Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger.

As the highest-ranking member of the cabinet, the Secretary of State is the third-highest official of the executive branch of the Federal Government of the United States, after the President and Vice President and is fourth in line to succeed the Presidency, coming after the Vice President, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the President pro tempore of the Senate.  Six Secretaries of State have gone on to be elected President.  Others, including Kerry, Hillary Clinton, William Seward, and Henry Clay have been unsuccessful presidential candidates, either before or after their term of office as Secretary of State.

As the head of the United States Foreign Service, the Secretary of State is responsible for management of the diplomatic service of the United States.  The foreign service employs about 12,000 people domestically and internationally, and supports 265 United States diplomatic missions around the world, including ambassadors to various nations.

The nature of the position means that Secretaries of State engage in travel around the world.  The record for most countries visited in a secretary's tenure is 112, by Hillary Rodham Clinton.   Second is Madeleine Albright with 96.  The record for most air miles traveled in a secretary's tenure is 1.06 million miles, by John Kerry.  Second is Rice's 1.059 million miles and third is Clinton's 956,733 miles.

When there is a vacancy in the office of Secretary of State, the duties are exercised either by another member of the cabinet, or, in more recent times, by a high-ranking official of the State Department until the President appoints, and the United States Senate confirms, a new Secretary.

Charles Macintosh and the Macintosh Raincoat
< Introduction: The Invention of Elastic
In 1823, Scottish chemist Charles Macintosh patented a method for making waterproof garments by using rubber dissolved in coal-tar naphtha for cementing two pieces of cloth together.
The now famous macintosh raincoat was named after Charles Macintosh. Macintosh raincoats were first made using the methods developed by Charles Macintosh.
Charles Macintosh Invents Waterproof Fabric
While he was trying to find uses for the waste products of gasworks, Macintosh discovered that coal-tar naphtha dissolved india rubber.         He took wool cloth and painted one side with the dissolved rubber preparation and placed another layer of wool cloth on top.
Improvements to Waterproof Fabrics
This created the first practical waterproof fabric, but the fabric was not perfect. It was easy to puncture when it was seamed, the natural oil in wool caused the rubber cement to deteriorate.

How to Write a Business Plan
In cold weather the fabric became stiffer and in hot weather the fabric became sticky. When vulcanized rubber was invented in 1839, Macintosh's fabrics improved since the new rubber could withstand temperature changes.

What is an ISA? - Moneysupermarket.com
What is an ISA?
What is an ISA?
Between now and the beginning of April is a crucial time for the nationâs savers.
What is an ISA?
Why? Because this is the window of opportunity left to cash in on our tax-free ISA allowances.
The tax advantages of these kinds of savings accounts make them hands-down the best way for most people to save.
But youâll need to know what an ISA is before you can understand the benefits.
So here is our five-minute guide to everything you need to know about ISAs.
What is an ISA?
Whatâs special about an ISA (which stands for an Individual Savings Account) is that it does not charge tax on the interest you earn. This is up to a certain annual limit which we will come to later.
In technical speak an ISA is a savings account which is held in a tax-free wrapper.
For higher-rate taxpayers, this means avoiding income tax at 40% on any savings interest, while for savers in the basic-rate tax band it provides a saving of 20%.
Those few paying additional rate tax will avoid tax on interest at 50% (though this will fall to 45% from the next tax year).
If you use the stocks and shares part of your ISA (which we will explain later) you will not have to pay Capital Gains Tax on your profits. When it comes to income tax, if you are a higher or an additional rate taxpayer, you will not have to pay those relative top slices of income tax on your dividends.
How much can I pay into an ISA?
For this tax year (up to April 5), the total ISA allowance per adult is Â£11,280.
You can only put up to Â£5,640 of this amount into a cash ISA, though.
The remaining Â£5,640 will have to be invested in an equity or stocks and shares, ISA.
From next tax year, the ISA allowance will increase to a total Â£11,520 of which Â£5,760 can be held in cash.
Junior ISAs, which replaced the Child Trust Fund in 2011, can hold up to Â£3,600 this tax year (going up to Â£3,720 next tax year) and the money can be split between cash and stocks and shares.
When and how can I invest?
Whether you want to use your full stocks and shares ISA allowance or just your cash allowance, you only have until April 5 to do either for the current 2012/2013 tax year.
You cannot roll it over to the next tax year, so it will be lost forever if you do not.
It is also worth noting that any money paid into your cash ISA and then withdrawn will still count towards your ISA allowance.
So if you paid the maximum Â£5,640 into your account and then withdraw Â£1,000, you will not be able to pay any more in before the end of the tax year due to this rule.
What different sorts of ISAs are available?
As long as you stay within the limits described above, you can open one cash ISA, and one stocks and shares ISA each tax year.
As indicated, only up to half of your allowance can be put into a cash ISA. Just like with standard savings accounts, you can choose to take an easy access ISA with a variable rate of interest, or lock in your money for a pre-set term at a (usually) more competitive fixed rate.
For qualifying children, parents can also invest in a Junior ISA that will be free of tax until the child reaches 18 and the money becomes theirs. Bear in mind these accounts are always held in the childâs name.
Do I have to split my money between cash and stocks and shares?
You do not have to split your ISA allowance between cash and other assets.
It is possible to invest the full Â£11,280 allowance in a stocks and shares ISA, within which you can choose the underlying investments â just like with a personal pension, for example.
Assets that can be held in a stocks and shares ISA include unit trusts, investment trusts, open ended investment companies, bonds, individual shares and exchange traded funds.
Remember, though, that while you can move money from a cash ISA into a stocks and shares ISA, you cannot transfer funds from an equity account to a cash one.
Can I switch to a better ISA if I already have one?
It is possible to transfer money invested in previous tax years between both cash and stocks and shares ISAs without losing the tax-free status.
However, you need to be careful not to physically withdraw the funds as this will result in you losing the tax breaks, just as you would if you withdrew a sum of money from the account.
Rather than closing your existing ISA and then looking to move the money into another account, you must therefore arrange a transfer with the provider to which you want to switch.
As not all accounts will accept transfers, this is something to bear in mind when comparing deals, as is the fact that some providers charge exit fees.
In the next few weeks, savings providers will be unveiling their menu of ISA deals as the new tax-year approaches. You can keep abreast of these and shop around for the best deals on MoneySupermarketâs ISA channel .

Passage:
Wolves Eat Dogs
Wolves Eat Dogs is a crime novel by Martin Cruz Smith, set in Russia and Ukraine in the year 2004. It is the fifth novel to feature Investigator Arkady Renko and the first one taking place during the new independent era.  

Plot

Russia has changed from a Communist to capitalist state, and Ukraine has seceded from the former Soviet Union. When Pavel "Pasha" Ivanov, one of the leading members of Russia's new billionaire class, dies in an apparent suicide, Renko investigates. Pasha fell from the balcony of his penthouse apartment, and all the signs point to his having been alone at the time. The only anomaly is a large mound of table salt in the victim's wardrobe.

Despite interference from his own boss as well as from other persons of power, Renko continues his investigation by questioning Pasha's friends and associates. There is apparently some kind of dark secret in Ivanov's past, and Pasha was always very depressed around May Day. Just before he is forcefully removed from the investigation, Arkady returns alone to Pasha's apartment and reconstructs his movements on the night he died. In the drawer of his bureau, Arkady finds a radiation dosimeter wrapped in a blood-stained handkerchief.  Turning it on, he finds that the entire apartment is radioactive, the highest levels coming from the mound of salt.  Arkady concludes that Ivanov did indeed commit suicide but that it was under a form of duress.

Explanation of the title

There are a number of possible interpretations of the title:
*Wolves are said to attack domesticated canines out of the sentiment that the dogs have betrayed their own species by living with and depending on humans for their survival. The contemptible dogs have unforgivingly traded their priceless freedom for food, security and other creature comforts.
*The murderer, when revealed, describes himself as a wolf, not so much for any violence or viciousness in his character, but because he considers himself a true predator: attacking his victims, and disposing of his unreliable associates, without compunction.  One of these associates, on his deathbed, mentions playing "the Wolf" in a school production of "Peter and the Wolf," and fancied himself as a wolf, "until I met a real one."
*The title can also be taken as a metaphor describing the corruption surrounding Arkady; the "wolves" being large organizations or powerful men that eat the "dogs" (meaningless men like Arkady Renko), who are insignificant in society and prove to be nothing more but an obstacle that must be eradicated. As wolves hunt in packs to overpower their prey, so do businesses and large organizations in this novel.

Allusions to real-life history, persons, or places

*Most of the novel takes place in the "dead zone" around the site of the Chernobyl disaster.  To "amuse" a company at dinner one night, Alex tells his own dramatic story of exactly how the meltdown occurred.
*Oddly, the novel predates by several years the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, which bears certain similarities to the attacks on Pasha Ivanov.
*Though there are several radioactive isotopes found at the site of the Chernobyl disaster, Caesium-137 is the most common (which may be why the killer chooses it to attack Ivanov and Timofeyev).

Passage:
Rodney riots
The Rodney riots were  riots and civil disturbances in Kingston, Jamaica in October 1968.

The riots were inspired when the Jamaican government of Hugh Shearer banned Guyanese university lecturer Dr. Walter Rodney from returning to his teaching position at the University of the West Indies. Rodney, a historian of Africa had been active in the Black power movement, and had been sharply critical of the middle class in many Caribbean countries. Rodney was an avowed socialist who worked with the poor of Jamaica in an attempt to raise their political and cultural consciousness.

When Rodney attended a black writers' conference in Montreal, Canada in October 1968 the government took the opportunity to ban him from returning, citing among other things trips to Cuba and the USSR as justification.

On learning of the ban, students at UWI, Mona began a demonstration under the leadership of the Guild of Undergraduates, closing down the campus. They then proceeded to march first to the prime minister's residence, and then to the parliament building in Kingston. On the way many more demonstrators joined in, and eventually the disturbance became increasingly violent spreading across the city. Eventually, several people were killed and there were millions of dollars in property damages.

The riots were part of an emerging black consciousness movement in the Caribbean, and played a role in the mutiny of soldiers in Trinidad and Tobago two years later.
Question:
The ‘Rodney Riots’ took place on which Caribbean island in October 1968?

Jamica

The Jeff Probst Show
The Jeff Probst Show was an American syndicated talk show hosted by Survivor host Jeff Probst, who also served as an executive producer. This was his first television talk foray, which is co-produced by Big Ticket Television, and distributed by CBS Television Distribution, which handles the distribution rights in the United States and Canada.  The hour-long program debuted on September 10, 2012. 

On February 13, 2013, CBS Television Distribution announced the cancellation of The Jeff Probst Show after only one season.  Despite the series finale airing May 22, 2013, unaired episodes were aired during the summer. 

Format

The program follows the same general interest format platform as Anderson Live, Katie and The Ricki Lake Show; the latter two debuted at the same time as Probst's.  Each episode is one hour long and centered on a topic in which guests and audience members interact about to find a common ground. On January 14, 2013, former The Facts of Life star and Survivor: Philippines contestant Lisa Whelchel joined Probst as co-host for several episodes. 

"On The Couch"

Originally referred to as "Guys on the Couch", the "On The Couch" segment consists of a panel of guests taking questions from the audience or discussing current odd news topics.

"Ambush Adventure"

Jeff will randomly initiate an "Ambush Adventure" when he asks a guest on the show or an audience member to take a step outside their comfort zone. Prior to knowing what the Ambush Adventure is, the participant must say "yes". Once the participant agrees to the Ambush Adventure, they find out the adventure.

Passage:
Give me liberty, or give me death!
"Give me liberty, or give me death!" is a quotation attributed to Patrick Henry from a speech he made to the Virginia Convention on March 23, 1775, at St. John's Church in Richmond, Virginia.

He is credited with having swung the balance in convincing the convention to pass a resolution delivering Virginian troops for the Revolutionary War. Among the delegates to the convention were future U.S. Presidents Thomas Jefferson and George Washington.

Publication

The speech was not published until  the Port Folio printed a version of it in 1815..  The version of the speech that is known today first appeared in print in William Wirt's 1817 biography of Henry.  There is debate among historians as to whether, and to what extent, Henry or Wirt should be credited with authorship of the speech and its famous closing words. 

Reception

Whatever the exact words of Henry were, there can be no doubt of their impact. According to Edmund Randolph, the convention sat in silence for several minutes afterwards. Thomas Marshall told his son John Marshall, who later became Chief Justice of the United States, that the speech was “one of the most bold, vehement, and animated pieces of eloquence that had ever been delivered.”  Edward Carrington, who was listening outside a window of the church, asked to be buried on that spot. In 1810, he got his wish. And the drafter of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, George Mason, said, “Every word he says not only engages but commands the attention, and your passions are no longer your own when he addresses them.” More immediately, the resolution, declaring the United Colonies to be independent of the Kingdom of Great Britain, passed, and Henry was named chairman of the committee assigned to build a militia. Britain's royal governor, Lord Dunmore,  reacted by seizing the gunpowder in the public magazine at Williamsburg—Virginia’s equivalent of the battles of Lexington and Concord. Whatever the exact words of Henry were, “scholars, understandably, are troubled by the way Wirt brought into print Henry’s classic Liberty or Death speech,” wrote historian Bernard Mayo. “Yet . . . its expressions. . . seemed to have burned themselves into men’s memories. Certainly its spirit is that of the fiery orator who in 1775 so powerfully influenced Virginians and events leading to American independence.” 

Precursors

There have been similar phrases used before Henry's speech. The play, Cato, a Tragedy, was popular in the Colonies and well known by the Founding Fathers, who would quote from the play. George Washington had this play performed for the Continental Army at Valley Forge.  It contains the line, "It is not now time to talk of aught/But chains or conquest, liberty or death" (Act II, Scene 4).  The phrase "Liberty or Death" also appears on the Culpeper Minutemen flag of 1775. 

"Liberty or death" in other contexts
 
The phrase appears in other nationalist contexts.  The national anthem of Uruguay, Orientales, la Patria o la Tumba, contains the line ¡Libertad o con gloria morir! (Liberty or with glory to die!)  The motto of Greece is "Liberty or Death" (Eleftheria i thanatos). A popular (and possibly concocted) story in Brazil relates that in 1822, the emperor Dom Pedro I uttered the famous Dom_Pedro_I#Independence_or_Death|Cry from [the river] Ipiranga, "Independence or Death" (Independência ou Morte), when Brazil was still a colony of Portugal. In March 1941 the motto of the public demonstrations in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia against signing the treaty with Nazi Germany was "Better grave than slave" (Bolje grob nego rob). More recently, in China, Ren Jianyu, a 25-year-old former college student "village official" was given a two-year re-education through labor sentence for an online anti-CPC speech. A T-shirt of Ren's saying "Give me liberty or give me death!" (in Chinese) has been taken as evidence of his anti-social guilt.

Passage:
Surrey Heath (UK Parliament constituency)
Surrey Heath is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2005 by Michael Gove, a Conservative.

Boundaries

Surrey Heath occupies the northwest corner of the county. It has electoral wards:
*Bagshot, Bisley, Chobham, Frimley, Frimley Green, Heatherside, Lightwater, Mytchett and Deepcut, Old Dean, Parkside, St Michaels, St Pauls, Town, Watchett, West End, and Windlesham in the Surrey Heath District
*Ash South and Tongham, Ash Vale, and Ash Wharf in the Borough of Guildford.

The largest town is Camberley. The Boundary Commission made no boundary changes for Surrey Heath in the Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies before the 2010 general election.

The large village of Ash with Ash Vale and smaller one of Tongham are contiguous, similar to Frimley and Frimley Green.

History

The constituency was created in 1997 from the most part of the seat of North West Surrey (which was abolished) and smaller parts of Woking and Guildford, seats which remain.

On the seat's creation, Nick Hawkins was elected to Parliament following the retirement of Surrey North West MP Michael Grylls who in 1992 achieved a majority of 28,392.  One of Hawkins' opponents for selection was future Speaker, John Bercow. Bercow was selected as the Conservative candidate for the Buckingham constituency on the same day. 

In 2004 the Conservative constituency association, then the richest in the country, deselected their MP Nick Hawkins in the hope of obtaining an MP of Cabinet calibre. 

;Prominent members
Present Member since 2005, Michael Gove was formerly Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor. 

Constituency profile

In terms of housing 70% of homes are detached or semi-detached at the 2011 census.  The detached percentage (45.2%) was at that time the second highest in the South East, behind the New Forest.   The area is well connected to London Heathrow Airport, IT, telecommunications and logistics centres of the M3 and M4 'corridors' and to the military towns of Aldershot and Sandhurst.  Farnborough with its civil, private aviation base with certain military uses is also nearby, as is Blackbushe Airport.

Workless claimants, registered jobseekers,  were in November 2012 significantly lower than the national average of 3.8%, at 1.7% of the population based on a statistical compilation by The Guardian. 

The constituency is one of the Conservative party's safest seats, with most wards firmly in their camp, the exception being the Old Dean ward which usually votes Labour at local level. According to the British Election Study, it is the most right-wing seat in the UK.
