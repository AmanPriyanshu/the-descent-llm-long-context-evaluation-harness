Passage:
Doctor Jones
"Doctor Jones" is a song by Danish dance-pop group Aqua. Released as the band's fifth single overall, it was the follow-up to their most successful song "Barbie Girl" in many regions. "Doctor Jones" was a similarly pop-oriented hit which sold well across the globe and ended the assumptions that Aqua would be a one-hit wonder; although they would remain so in America as "Barbie Girl" was their only hit there until "Lollipop (Candyman)" was released and hit the top 40 on the Hot 100.

"Doctor Jones" was released around the world in a number of months, with the first release being in October 1997. Most of the releases would be in November 1997, with it hitting the charts in Japan, Scandinavia and mainland Europe in that month. December 1997 saw the Australian release achieve a successful chart placing at No. 1 for seven consecutive weeks, before the song made its impact in the UK in February of the following year. There, it became the group's second number one single, topping the chart for three weeks.

The song can also be heard in the 1998 Disney film I'll Be Home for Christmas. Allie Henderson (Jessica Biel) sings along with the song while riding in a car through Colorado.

Music video

The music video implies the song is based around the Indiana Jones character from the film series of the same name, with René Dif playing Jones and rescuing his fellow band members from a stereotypical voodoo tribe. The title logo is written in a similar form to that of the Indiana Jones logo. There is also a shot of airplane's flight path over a map, which is used in the film series. The lyric "Dr. Jones, wake up now" may also be a reference to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom where Short Round implores Indiana Jones to "wake up" after being brainwashed by the blood of Kālī Ma, or during a scene on an airplane when Willie Scott says, "Calling Dr. Jones, wake up!".

The video was one of five Aqua-videos directed by Peder Pedersen, who would later spoof the Indiana Jones-movies again in his computer-animated short film Lego Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Brick (2008).

Give Me Just a Little More Time
"Give Me Just a Little More Time" is the debut single for Chairmen of the Board, released in 1970 through Capitol Records on Holland–Dozier–Holland's Invictus Records label.

The song was written and produced by Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, Edward Holland, Jr., and Ron Dunbar. Because of the then still-pending lawsuit against Holland-Dozier-Holland from their former employers, Motown, the trio credited themselves with the pseudonym "Edythe Wayne" for this song and many other early Invictus/Hot Wax releases. "Give Me Just a Little More Time" features Chairmen of the Board lead singer General Johnson as the narrator, begging a lover not to rush intimacy: "We both want the sweetness in life/ But these things don't come overnight."

Members of Motown's in-house band, The Funk Brothers, who played all of Holland-Dozier-Holland's previous hits, played on this recording as well as many other Invictus/Hot Wax recordings. 

"Give Me Just a Little More Time", backed with "Since the Days of Pigtails", peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, making it the best-performing of the Chairmen's singles, and the first of the Chairmen's four Billboard Hot 100 Top 40 pop hits. The single also peaked at number-eight on the Billboard R&B Singles chart. It reached number three in the UK Singles Chart in September 1970, having already sold more than one million copies in the US.  The first Chairmen of the Board LP, a self-titled release, included the single; after the single's success, the Chairmen of the Board album was reissued as Give Me Just a Little More Time.

In 1982, American R&B singer Angela Clemmons remade the song and it peaked at #4 on Billboard's Hot Dance Music\Club Play Singles chart.

Credits and personnel

The Funk Brothers who played on "Give Me Just A Little More Time" included:
* Bass: Bob Babbitt
* Guitarists: Dennis Coffey, Eddie Willis, and Ray Monette
* Keyboards: Johnny Griffith
* Drums: Richard "Pistol" Allen
* Percussion: Jack Ashford 

Kylie Minogue version

"Give Me Just a Little More Time" was covered in 1992 by Australian pop singer Kylie Minogue. Minogue's version was featured in a commercial for Accurist watches at the time.  It was one of the last tracks to be recorded for her fourth album, Let's Get to It. It peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart, assisted by its club-oriented B-side "Do You Dare?" and sold 325,000 copies. 
"Give Me Just a Little More Time" is the only song from Let's Get to It to be included on Minogue's career-spanning compilation Ultimate Kylie and The Best of Kylie Minogue. The B-side "Do You Dare?" was included on Minogue's Greatest Remixes (Vol. 2), and was performed on her Showgirl: The Greatest Hits Tour, Showgirl: The Homecoming Tour, and For You, For Me concert tours.

Background

"I went to bed, and, and I literally was in bed thinking of all these records that I had in my life [...] I was going through the library mentally thinking, what song would she never have done that we could do that was just a great song. And one of my favorite songs was Chairman of the Board's 'Give Me Just a Little More Time.'"

Harriet Tubman replaces Andrew Jackson on the face of $20 ...
Harriet Tubman replaces Andrew Jackson on the face of $20 dollar bill
Harriet Tubman replaces Andrew Jackson on the face of $20 dollar bill
By  Sarah Menendez

Hamilton fans are "Satisfied" with Treasury Secretary decision to let the founding father "Stay Alive" on the $10 dollar bill.  - T.J. Kirkpatrick/Getty Images
U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew announced changes to the $20, $10 and $5 bills Wednesday, confirming that abolitionist leader Harriet Tubman will replace president Andrew Jackson on the face of the $20 dollar bill.
The list of changes adds new figures and images to bills rather than completely replacing the political leaders currently featured. Jackson will still be on the reverse side of the $20 note in some way. Founding father Alexander Hamilton’s place on the face of the $10 dollar bill will remain unchanged and while the back of the bill will continue to depict the Treasury building, it will also show images of the women's suffrage movement.
Lincoln will remain on the face of the $5 dollar, however, the back will include historical events at the Lincoln Memorial, including African American singer Marian Anderson singing on the steps next to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and an image of Martin Luther King Jr. delivering his "I have a dream" speech.
The Treasury will reveal the redesigned bills put into production by 2020, to mark the 100th anniversary of the 19th amendment which legalized voting for women.
Lew emphasized that these redesigns are focused on telling stories of historical events through images depicted on the bills.  Harriet Tubman's legacy is "an essential story about the history of American democracy," he told reporters on a press call.
“She changed the course of this country by direct action," Lew said.  "That is a legacy that we all do well to learn from, which is why she is the right image for our next $20 dollar bill.”
Tubman was one of the many women considered. Other candidates included Susan B. Anthony, Eleanor Roosevelt and Rosa Parks. The Treasury department hosted public town halls, round table meetings and calls for public input on social media.
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen echoed Lew's sentiment in a statement released on Wednesday. "Throughout American history, women have made important contributions to the free and democratic society we enjoy today," said Yellen.  "I welcome the decision by the Treasury Department to honor these achievements."
In an interview with Marketplace’s Kai Ryssdal earlier this month, Lew talked about the movement to depict more women on the dollar bills. 
“We've heard from millions of Americans. That means there's people from around the country at school lunch tables, in senior centers, at workplaces talking about what woman should we recognize and how have women contributed to democracy in America,” said Lew. 
 
This comes almost a year after the Treasury Secretary sent a memo to the president suggesting changes to the currency.
In his memo, Lew initially proposed getting rid of Hamilton, which did not sit well with the public. After the wild success of “Hamilton,” the hip-hop musical about the first Treasury secretary, fans rallied around the idea of keeping him on the $10.
During a visit to the White House, Pulitzer prize winner and creator of “Hamilton,” Lin Manuel-Miranda lobbied current Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to keep Hamilton on the bill. Turns out, the non-stop support for Hamilton from “Hamilton” worked.

Akita : Dog Breed Selector : Animal Planet
Akita : Dog Breed Selector : Animal Planet
Watch Video
The Akita appreciates mental and physical exercise every day. It needs the chance to run in a safe area or on leash for a long jog. Given ample exercise and training, it can be a quiet and well-mannered house dog. The Akita is able to live outdoors in temperate or cool climates, but it is happiest if it can spend most of its time with its family. The coat needs brushing about once a week to remove dead hair, more often when shedding. Akitas tend to be somewhat messy drinkers!
 Major concerns: CHD, PRA
 Minor concerns: elbow dysplasia, pemphigus, sebaceous adenitis, gastric torsion
 Occasionally seen: PRA, patellar luxation, VKH-like syndrome, entropion, epilepsy, cataracts,  polyneuropathy, renal cortical hypoplasia
 Suggested tests: hip, elbow, eye
 Life span: 10  12 years
 Note: Onions have been documented to cause changes in the red-blood cells of Akitas.
Watch Video
The Akita is perhaps the most renowned and venerated of the native Japanese breeds. Although it bears a likeness to dogs from ancient Japanese tombs, the modern Akita traces back to the 17th century, when a nobleman with a keen interest in dogs was exiled to the Akita Prefecture of the island of Honshu, a rugged area with intensely cold winters. He challenged the landowners there to compete in breeding a race of powerful hunting dogs. These dogs distinguished themselves in the hunting of bear, deer and wild boar, holding the game at bay for the hunter. These Akita forebears were called matagi-inu, or "hunting dog." The breed's numbers and quality varied over the next 300 years. In the late 1800s, it underwent a period when it was used as a fighting dog, and some were even crossed with other breeds in an attempt to enhance its fighting prowess. In 1927, the Akita-inu Hozankai Society of Japan was formed to preserve the original Akita, and in 1931 the Akita was designated as one of Japan's natural treasures. The most honored Akita of all time was Haichiko, who greeted his master every evening at the train station to accompany him home. When his master died at work one day, Haichiko waited for him and continued to return and wait for his master every day until he died nine years later on March 8, 1935. Today, a statue and annual ceremony pay homage to Haichiko's loyalty. The first Akita arrived in America in 1937, when Helen Keller returned from Japan with one. Following World War II, servicemen returned home with Akitas from Japan. The breed's popularity grew slowly until it received AKC recognition in 1972. Since then, it has steadily gained admirers and continues to grow in popularity. The Akita is now used as a guard and police dog in Japan.

Passage:
St. Stephen's Day
St. Stephen's Day, or the Feast of Saint Stephen, is a Christian saint's day to commemorate Saint Stephen, the first Christian martyr or protomartyr, celebrated on 26 December in the Western Church and 27 December in the Eastern Church. Many Eastern Orthodox churches adhere to the Julian calendar and mark St. Stephen's Day on 27 December according to that calendar, which places it on 9 January of the Gregorian calendar used in secular contexts. In the denominations of Western Christianity, Saint Stephen's Day marks the second day of Christmastide.  

It is an official public holiday in Alsace-Moselle, Austria, Balearic Islands, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Catalonia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Montenegro, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Ukraine, and Switzerland. The date is also a public holiday in those countries that celebrate Boxing Day on the day in addition to or instead of St. Stephen's Day, such as Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.

Ireland

In Ireland, the day is one of nine official public holidays. 

In Irish, it is called ' or ', meaning the Day of the Wren or Wren's Day. When used in this context, "wren" is often pronounced "ran".  This name alludes to several legends, including those found in Ireland, linking episodes in the life of Jesus to the wren. People dress up in old clothes, wear straw hats and travel from door to door with fake wrens (previously real wrens were killed) and they dance, sing and play music. This tradition is less common than it was a couple of generations ago.   Depending on which region of the country, they are called wrenboys and mummers. A Mummer's Festival is held at this time every year in the village of New Inn, County Galway and Dingle in County Kerry. St. Stephen's Day is a popular day for visiting family members and going to the theatre to see a pantomime. 

Wales

St. Stephen's Day in Wales is known as ', celebrated every year on 26 December. One ancient Welsh custom, discontinued in the 19th century, included bleeding of livestock and "holming" by beating with holly branches of late risers and female servants. The ceremony reputedly brought good luck. 

Catalonia

St. Stephen's Day (') on 26 December is a traditional Catalan holiday. It is celebrated right after Christmas, with a big meal including '. These are stuffed with the ground remaining meat from the ', turkey, or ' of the previous day.

Alsace and Moselle

St. Stephen's Day (') is a heritage due to the local German culture even after French annexation in 1918.

Austria, Germany and the Czech Republic

' is a public holiday in mainly Catholic Austria. In the Archdiocese of Vienna, the day of patron saint St. Stephen is even celebrated on a Sunday within the Octave of Christmas, the feast of the Holy Family. Similar to the adjacent regions of Bavaria, numerous ancient customs still continued to this day, such as ceremonial horseback rides and blessing of horses, or the "stoning" drinking ritual celebrated by young men after attending church service.

The 26th of December is – as Second Day of Christmas  (, ) – a public holiday in Germany and the Czech Republic.

Serbia

St. Stephen is the patron saint of Serbia. St. Stephen's Day falls on 9 January because the Serbian Orthodox Church adheres to the Julian calendar. Serbian medieval rulers' title was Stefan (Stephen). The day is not a public holiday in Serbia.

Republika Srpska

St. Stephen is also the patron saint of Republika Srpska, one of two entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina. St. Stephen's Day, 9 January, is celebrated as the Day of the Republika Srpska or Dan Republike, though mainly as an anniversary of the 1992 events rather than as a religious feast.

Finland

The most well known tradition linked to the day is "the ride of Stephen's Day" which refers to a sleigh ride with horses. These merry rides along village streets were seen in contrast to the silent and pious mood of the preceding Christmas days.

Another old tradition was parades with singers and people dressed in Christmas suits. At some areas these parades were related to checking forthcoming brides. Stephen's Day used to be a popular day for weddings as well. These days a related tradition is dances of Stephen's Day which are held in several restaurants and dance halls.

Candle in the Wind
"Candle in the Wind" is a threnody song with music and lyrics by Elton John and Bernie Taupin. It was originally written in 1973, in honor of Marilyn Monroe,  who had died 11 years earlier.

In 1997, John performed a rewritten version of the song as a tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales. This version of the song was released as a single and reached No. 1 in many countries, proving a much greater success than the original, officially being listed as the second best-selling single of all time, behind Bing Crosby's "White Christmas".

Original version

The original version in the key of E major appeared on John's 1973 album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road recorded in May 1973 and released in 1974. The lyrics of the song are a sympathetic portrayal of the life of Marilyn Monroe. (The song's opening line "Goodbye, Norma Jeane" refers to Monroe's real name, Norma Jean Baker.) In the Eagle Vision documentary on the making of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Taupin said the song is about "the idea of fame or youth or somebody being cut short in the prime of their life. The song could have been about James Dean, it could have been about Montgomery Clift, it could have been about Jim Morrison ... how we glamorize death, how we immortalize people." The single release of the original song reached No. 11 in the UK charts in 1974. At the time, it was not released as a single in the United States ("Bennie and the Jets" was chosen instead). Taupin was inspired to write the song after hearing the phrase "candle in the wind" used in tribute to Janis Joplin.

This version is ranked #347 on Rolling Stones list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

During a concert on 7 April 1990, at Farm Aid IV, John dedicated the song to Ryan White, who had been suffering from AIDS. White died from AIDS complications the next day.

* Davey Johnstone – electric guitar, acoustic guitar, backing vocals

1997 version

"Candle in the Wind 1997" or "Goodbye England's Rose" is a re-recording of "Candle in the Wind" as a tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales. Released in 1997, the song peaked at No. 1 in the United Kingdom, becoming John's fourth No. 1 single. It also peaked at No. 1 in several other countries. The Guinness Book of Records in 2007 stated that "Candle in the Wind 1997" is the biggest-selling single "since records began", but that Bing Crosby's "White Christmas" has sold the most copies.  The record of this version was produced by George Martin.

2003 acoustic remix

Using the same vocal take as the original 1973 recording, engineer Greg Penny stripped away all instrumentation except Davey Johnstone's acoustic guitar. Even the double-tracking of the lead vocal was removed, leaving Elton and the original backing vocal arrangement of Dee Murray, Nigel Olsson and Davey Johnstone.

The song was written by Dwyer after Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) asked him to write a song that would be "Something like 'Candle In The Wind'... But 5,000 times better". The song was also played at the unity concert in the season 6 finale of the show.
*"Candle in the Wind" is mentioned in the BoJack Horseman episode "Still Broken" by one of the show's main characters, Princess Carolyn (voiced by Amy Sedaris), who states "You know when someone dies, everyone wants to buy their shit?...You don't think Elton John was raking it in when Diana died?

Home Before Dark
Home Before Dark is the twenty-seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Neil Diamond. Released on May 5, 2008; it was the artist's second album for American Recordings.

Home Before Dark received generally positive reviews from critics upon its release and topped the national albums charts in the United States, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand. It has since been accredited with album certifications in several regions.

In May 2008, at the age of 67, Neil Diamond was the oldest performer to have a number one record.  This mark was previously held by Bob Dylan in 2006 with his Modern Times album, released when he was 65. However, Bob Dylan's 2009 album, Together Through Life, earned Dylan that position again since Dylan released his most recent work at 67 years and 11 months unlike Diamond releasing Home Before Dark at 67 years and 3 months.

The album is Diamond's second to be produced by Rick Rubin, a  producer of hip-hop and heavy metal music, who had discovered a talent for re-invigorating the careers of musicians when he produced Aerosmith and a string of albums with Johnny Cash. After Cash's death, Diamond became the next artist to find his career given a shot in the arm, via Rubin's production on his 2005 album 12 Songs. The album consists of original works and some remakes, and was mixed by Dana Nielsen. The orchestral parts were arranged and conducted by David Campbell

Heroic: Florence Nightingale has been branded neurotic and sexually repressed
The BBC has been accused of demeaning Florence Nightingale by labelling her as a ‘manipulative, neurotic and sexually repressed woman’.
Academics have complained to BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten about a series of documentaries that belittle the nurse.
They also criticise BBC ‘sexism’ in referring to Miss Nightingale by her first name.

They say a documentary on Charles Darwin for example would never call him ‘Charlie’.
The academics from University College London and the University of Manchester also attack claims that the nurse inadvertently  killed troops during the Crimean War through medical error.
The group, led by Professor Lynn MacDonald from the University of Guelph in Canada, called on the BBC to withdraw from shops copies of Florence Nightingale: Iron Maiden from 2001 and Reputations: Florence Nightingale from 2008.
The programmes are now on sale as teaching aids.
The letter said: 'We ask the    BBC to (preferably) withdraw the two hostile films, at the very least to    identify them as including unsubstantiated and fictional portrayals of    Nightingale.
'Of course scholars may differ in interpretation, but still    the BBC's record is appalling. Not one of the academics used to attack    Nightingale ever published his/her accusations in a peer-reviewed book or    journal.'
A BBC spokesman said the programmes involved a ‘broad range of sources, giving a broad range of opinions’.

Jane (comic strip)
Jane was a comic strip created and drawn by Norman Pett exclusively for the British tabloid newspaper The Daily Mirror from 5 December 1932 to 10 October 1959. 

Creation 

Jane was born when artist Norman Pett made a wager that he could create a comic strip as popular to adults as the strip Pip, Squeak and Wilfred was to children. Originally Pett's wife Mary modelled for him, but in the late 1930s, she abandoned modelling in pursuit of golf. Pett then teamed up with Chrystabel Leighton-Porter whom he met while she was modelling for a class in Birmingham.

Originally entitled Jane's Journal, Or the Diary of a Bright Young Thing, the salacious comic strip featured the misadventures of the title ingenue. The heroine had a habit of frequently (and most often inadvertently) losing her clothes. Her intimate confidant was a pet dachshund named Fritz. Her full name was Jane Gay, a play on the name Lady Jane Grey. The name "Gay" was a reference to her cheerful, fun-loving character and did not connote the modern homosexual implication.

The strip became very popular during the Second World War and was considered morale-boosting, inspiring a similar American version, Milton Caniff's comic strip Male Call. Until 1943, Jane rarely stripped beyond her undergarments, but then she made a fully nude appearance when getting out of a bath and clumsily falling into the middle of a crowd of British soldiers. 

Norman Pett's assistant Michael Hubbard continued, beginning in 1948, to develop the cartoon's original storyline until ending in 1959 – with charmer Georgie giving Jane a happy marriage and ending the series. The Mirror tried to revive the character on several occasions. One such comic strip was Jane, Daughter of Jane, who was apparently the original's grown-up offspring, but she lacked her mother's charm and innocence. Another attempt was made during the 1980s.

Jane visits America

During 1945, King Features Syndicate attempted to distribute Jane in the United States.  However, the nudity was too much for prudish American audiences, and the attempt ceased during 1946. 

Other comics in the tradition of, and possibly inspired by, Jane include Male Call, Sally the Sleuth and Little Annie Fanny. 

Adaptations

The strip inspired an eponymous stage play during the 1940s, with Leighton-Porter playing the character of Jane (see Jane on Stage). Chrystabel also featured in a 1949 movie, The Adventures of Jane, directed by Edward G. Whiting.  A 1987 movie, Jane and the Lost City, starring Kirsten Hughes in the title role, was directed by Terry Marcel.

A television series was made by the BBC between 1982 and 1984, featuring Glynis Barber in the title role. The first season was titled simply Jane, while the second was titled Jane in the Desert.  Despite the early evening scheduling slot, the show was decidedly risqué with Jane continuously stripping down to her underwear, including stockings and suspenders. At the end of the second series' closing episode she appeared topless momentarily. Despite considerable publicity in the press at the time of its original screening, the show became somewhat obscure and has never had a commercial video or DVD release. The show was briefly revived during 1985 as a three-part sequence shown over a single morning on Breakfast Television but without Glynis Barber in the main role.

Jane on stage

During and after World War Two, Chrystabel Leighton-Porter performed a striptease act as the character of Jane. In the war, it was compulsory for actors and entertainers to join ENSA (Entertainments National Service Association) whose job it was to organize entertainment for the troops, and although Chrystabel's audience were mainly soldiers, she was never asked by ENSA to perform on the front line.

"I think they felt that my show was a little too risqué, and perhaps risky to put on for a theatre full of lusty troops! It was different when I did stage shows in provincial theatres, because although there was a lot of boys there, there was always a lot of general public too. As well, it was in a slightly more controlled environment really,"  Chrystabel explains.

Some censors were concerned about the amount of clothes Chrystabel removed during the show. On one occasion, an official asked her: "But how do you cover your breasts?" Chrystabel replied: "With my hands." "My word!" exclaimed the man, "you must have very big hands!" 

The content of the act varied due to restrictions set in by local censors.
