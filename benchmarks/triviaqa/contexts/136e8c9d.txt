Passage:
Gentleman thief
A gentleman thief, lady thief, or  in the East, is a recurring stock character. A gentleman or lady thief usually has inherited wealth and is characterised by impeccable manners, charm, courteousness and the avoidance of physical force or intimidation to steal. As such, they do not steal to gain material wealth but for the thrill of the act itself, often combined in fiction with correcting a moral wrong, selecting wealthy targets, or stealing only particular rare and challenging objects.

In popular culture

In fictional works, the phantom thief is typically superb at stealing while maintaining a gentleman's manners and code of honour; for example, Robin Hood is a former Earl who steals from the rich to give to the poor, Raffles only steals from other gentlemen (and occasionally gives the object away to a good cause); Lupin steals from the rich who do not appreciate their art or treasures and redistributes it; Saint Tail steals back what was stolen or taken dishonestly, or rights the wrongs done to the innocent by implicating 'the real' criminals. Sly Cooper and his gang steals from other thieves and criminals.

A native of Mexico, marigolds have been grown in gardens throughout the world for hundreds of years.  Today, they are one of the most popular bedding plants in the United States.  Marigolds are easy to grow, bloom reliably all summer, and have few insect and disease problems.  The marigold's only shortcoming (for some people) is its pungent aroma.
There are numerous marigold varieties available to home gardeners.  Many of the commonly grown marigolds are varieties of African and French marigolds. Less known are the triploid hybrids and the signet marigolds. The African marigolds (Tagetes erecta) have large, double,  yellow-to-orange flowers from midsummer to frost.  Flowers may measure up to 5 inches across. Plant height varies from 10 to 36 inches.  African marigolds are excellent bedding plants.  Tall varieties can be used as  background plantings.  Suggested African marigolds for Iowa include varieties in the Inca and Perfection series. (A series is a group of closely related varieties with uniform characteristics, such as height,  spread, and flowering habit.  The only characteristic that varies within a series is flower color.)  African marigolds are also referred to as American marigolds.
The French marigolds (Tagetes patula) are smaller, bushier plants with flowers up to 2 inches across.  Flower colors are yellow, orange, and mahogany-red.  Many varieties have bicolored flowers.  Flower heads may be single or double.  Plant height ranges from 6 to 18 inches.  The French marigolds have a longer blooming season than the African marigolds.  They generally bloom from spring until frost.  The French marigolds also hold up better in rainy weather.  French marigolds are ideal for edging flower beds and in mass plantings.  They also do well in containers and window boxes.  Queen Sophia and Golden Gate are excellent French marigold varieties.  Varieties in the Boy, Early Spice, Hero, Janie, and Safari series also perform well in Iowa.
The triploid hybrids are crosses between the tall, vigorous African marigolds and the compact, free-flowering French marigolds.  Triploid hybrid marigolds are unable to set seed.  As a result, plants bloom repeatedly through the summer, even in hot weather.  One problem with the triploids is their low seed germination rate.  Average germination is around 50 percent.  Since the triploid hybrids are unable to produce viable seed, they also know as mule marigolds.
Signet marigolds (Tagetes tenuifolia) are quite different from most marigolds. Signet marigold plants are bushy with fine, lacy foliage.  The small, single flowers literally cover the plants in summer.  Flower colors range from yellow to orange.  They are also edible.  The flowers of signet marigolds have a spicy tarragon flavor.  The foliage has a pleasant lemon fragrance.  Signet marigolds are excellent plants for edging beds and in window boxes.  The varieties Golden Gem and Lemon Gem do well in Iowa.
There are basically three planting options available to home gardeners when planting marigolds.  Marigold seed can be sown directly outdoors when the danger of frost is past or started indoors 6 weeks prior to the last frost date.  Marigolds are also available as bedding plants at garden centers.
Planting site requirements for marigolds are full sun and a well-drained soil.  Plant spacing varies from 6 to 9 inches for the French marigolds and up to 18 inches for the taller African marigold varieties.
Summer care of marigolds is simple.  Water occasionally during dry weather and pinch off faded flowers to encourage additional bloom.  Tall African marigolds may require staking to prevent the plants from falling over or lodging during storms.
While marigolds are seldom bothered by insects and diseases, they are not problem free.  Spider mites can devastate marigolds in hot, dry weather. Grasshoppers can also cause considerable damage.  Aster yellows is an occasionally disease problem.  In a related matter, some gardeners plant marigolds in their vegetable gardens to repel harmful insects.  While the marigolds are an attractive addition to the garden, research studies have concluded they aren't effective in reducing insect damage on vegetable crops.

Liz Doogan-Hobbs MBE Takes Home Top Prize At National Business Award
December 6, 2012
Liz Doogan-Hobbs’
Liz Doogan-Hobbs’ story is the stuff of legend. Suffering a near fatal accident as a world champion sportswoman, she pursued a career in broadcasting before launching the phenomenally successful Liz Hobbs Group Ltd events company, credited with galvanising the dwindling British live music and horse-racing industries. Today, the 52 year old, from Newark has been named as winner of the 2012 NatWest everywoman Award, honouring the most passionate and dedicated woman business owner who has overcome significant challenges to achieve success.
The qualities that helped Liz Doogan-Hobbs become a World Champion have undoubtedly aided her meteoric business success.  It takes a certain type of person with raw grit and determination to suffer a near fatal accident and come back to successfully defend a world title, but Liz did just this when she became the World Water Ski Race Champion for the second time in 1983.
After retiring from competitive sport, Liz worked in media and entertainment before moving into artist management for sports, theatre and television personalities. Fusing her passions for sport and music she identified an opportunity to provide music concerts after sporting events.  This had two major benefits as a business model – with attendance at sporting events, horse racing in particular, in decline the introduction of live music opened the sport up to a new audience.  Furthermore the music industry was feeling the squeeze with the rise of internet downloads yet live performances continued to provide a significant income for artists.
Despite early scepticism the racing and music industries embraced the idea, which has since taken off.  Liz Hobbs Group now provides the largest revenue stream to the racing industry and has since expanded into other sports. Listed as one of the Sunday Times Fast Track 100 companies, Liz Hobbs Group turns over £7m annually and has worked with some of the world’s biggest artists including Tom Jones, Rod Stewart and Razorlight. Outside of work she has supported numerous charities and this year aims to raise £1 million for Breast Cancer Research.
The NatWest everywoman Awards are celebrating 10 years of showcasing the diversity and phenomenal success of women business owners across the UK. In the past decade, these awards have raised the profile of hundreds of women of all ages, across every imaginable sector, demonstrating the impact of female owned enterprises, which contribute a staggering £130 billion to the UK economy each year*.  The extraordinary achievements of previous winners and finalists have played a huge role in encouraging other women to start and grow a business.
Winner Liz Doogan-Hobbs MBE commented: “I would like to say thank you to NatWest Everywoman Awards, the sponsor of this award, my NatWest rock Andy Procter, and of course my family, who I’m thrilled are here. Coming here today and being among such inspirational businesswomen, I never imagined I would be crowned as the winner of the NatWest everywoman Award.  Everybody as individuals have the opportunity to realise their potential, they just have to want it!”
Commenting on this year’s winners, everywoman co-founder, Karen Gill MBE, says, “Over the past ten years we have uncovered incredible stories of professional triumphs, so many of which have been in the face of incredible adversity.  This year more than ever the judges were humbled by the extraordinary tenacity and determination shown by the finalists.  Drive to succeed takes on new meaning with these women and the word ‘inspiring’ doesn’t do justice to their achievements. We know that there are thousands of women around the UK with a business idea and we are here to support them as their concept turns into reality.  Today’s winners are testimony that with hard work and persistence – dreams of enterprise can come true.”
Andy Procter, Senior Relationship Manager, NatWest commented: “We are so proud of everything that Liz has achieved with the Liz Hobbs Group and there could not be a more worthy winner of the NatWest everywoman Award. The challenges that Liz has had to overcome to make her business the success that it is today have been significant and I have been privileged to work with Liz through some of these. I look forward to continuing to support Liz and her business, and to witnessing many more award successes!”
The awards were hosted by Olivia Sterns, of Bloomberg Television at the Dorchester and attended by a host of high profile women entrepreneurs including Cath Kidston MBE; Chrissie Rucker MBE, founder of The White Company; Anna Lee, co-founder of Storm Watches, and Eve Lom.

On this day, writer Fyodor Dostoevsky is led before a firing squad and prepared for execution. He had been convicted and sentenced to death on November 16 for allegedly taking part in antigovernment activities. However, at the last moment he was reprieved and sent into exile.
Dostoevsky’s father was a doctor at Moscow’s Hospital for the Poor, where he grew rich enough to by land and serfs. After his father’s death, Dostoevsky, who suffered from epilepsy, studied military engineering and became a civil servant while secretly writing novels. His first, Poor People, and his second, The Double, were both published in 1846–the first was a hit, the second a failure.
On December 22, 1849, Dostoevsky was led before the firing squad but received a last-minute reprieve and was sent to a Siberian labor camp, where he worked for four years. He was released in 1854 and worked as a soldier on the Mongolian frontier. He married a widow and finally returned to Russia in 1859. The following year, he founded a magazine, and two years after that he journeyed to Europe for the first time.
In 1864 and 1865, his wife and his brother died, the magazine folded, and Dostoevsky found himself deeply in debt, which he exacerbated by gambling.
In 1866, he published Crime and Punishment, one of his most popular works. In 1867, he married a stenographer, and the couple fled to Europe to escape his creditors. His novel The Possessed (1872) was successful, and the couple returned to St. Petersburg. He published The Brothers Karamazov in 1880 to immediate success, but died a year later.
