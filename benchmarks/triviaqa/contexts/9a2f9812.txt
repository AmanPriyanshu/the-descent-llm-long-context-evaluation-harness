Passage:
Kookaburra
Kookaburras are terrestrial tree kingfishers of the genus Dacelo native to Australia and New Guinea, which grow to between 28 – in length. The name is a loanword from Wiradjuri guuguubarra, onomatopoeic of its call. The single member of the genus Clytoceyx is commonly referred to as the shovel-billed kookaburra.

The kookaburra's loud call sounds like echoing human laughter. They are found in habitats ranging from humid forest to arid savanna, as well as in suburban areas with tall trees or near running water. Even though they belong to the larger group known as "kingfishers", kookaburras are not closely associated with water.

Classification and species

Four species of kookaburra can be found in Australia, New Guinea, and the Aru Islands.

Kookaburras are sexually dimorphic. This is noticeable in the blue-winged and the rufous-bellied, where males have blue tails and females have reddish-brown tails.
* Rufous-bellied kookaburra (Dacelo gaudichaud). (lowland New Guinea, Saibai island)
* Spangled kookaburra (Dacelo tyro). (Aru Islands, southern New Guinea)
* Blue-winged kookaburra (Dacelo leachii). (northern Australia, southern New Guinea)
* Laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae). (native to eastern Australia, introduced to southwest Australia)

Unusually for close relatives, the laughing and blue-winged species are direct competitors in the area where their ranges now overlap. This suggests that these two species evolved in isolation (possibly during a period when Australia and New Guinea were more distant - see Australia-New Guinea.

Behaviour

Kookaburras are almost exclusively carnivorous, eating mice, snakes, insects, small reptiles, and the young of other birds; they have also been known to take goldfish from garden ponds. In zoos they are usually fed food for birds of prey.

The most social birds will accept handouts and will take meat from barbecues. It is generally not advised to feed kookaburras ground beef or pet food as these do not include enough calcium and roughage. 

They are territorial, except for the rufous-bellied, which often live with their young from the previous season.  They often sing as a chorus to mark their territory.

Conservation

All kookaburra species are listed as Least Concern. Australian law protects native birds including kookaburras.

In culture 

Olly the Kookaburra was one of the three mascots chosen for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. The other mascots were Millie the Echidna and Syd the Platypus.

The distinctive sound of the laughing kookaburra's call is used in filmmaking and television productions, as well as certain Disney theme park attractions, regardless of African, Asian and South American jungle settings. Kookaburras have also appeared in video games (Lineage II, Battletoads, and World of Warcraft) and at least in one short story (Barry Wood's Nowhere to Go).

In William Arden's 1969 book, [http://www.tunneltwo.com/secrets/12.html The Mystery of the Laughing Shadow], (one of 'The Three Investigators' series for young readers), the laughing kookaburra is integral to the plot.
 
The children's television series Splatalot! includes an Australian character called "Kookaburra" (or "Kook"), whose costume includes decorative wings that recall the bird's plumage, and who is noted for his distinctive high-pitched laugh.

Music

* A well-known children's song, "Kookaburra"
* "Kookaburra", by Cocteau Twins, released on their EP Aikea-Guinea
* "Kookaburra" by John Vanderslice on 2007's Emerald City (album)
* The Kookaburras, an English band from the County Durham.
* The lyric "...the Laughing Kookaburras call.." appears in the song Across the Hills of Home on the album Something of Value by Eric Bogle

BFD Records and BFD Productions, which are the distributors and/or copyright holders of most of the garage rock and psychedelic rock compilation albums in the Pebbles series, have the address Kookaburra, Australia.

Postage stamps 

* A six pence stamp was issued in 1914.
* A three pence commemorative Australian stamp was issued for the 1928 Melbourne International Philatelic Exhibition, 
* A six pence stamp issued in 1932.
* A 38c Australian stamp issued in 1990 features a pair of kookaburras. 

Coins

An Australian coin known as the Silver Kookaburra minted annually since 1990. 

Yacht

The Australian 12 metre yacht Kookaburra III lost the America's Cup in 1987.[http://www.shipsonstamps.org/topics/html/amcup.htm Maritime Topics On Stamps, America Cup, Sailing]

Hockey 

The Australian Men's Hockey team is named after the kookaburra. They are currently (as of 2014) world champions in field hockey.

Question: "Why did Noah release a raven? Why did he later release a dove (Genesis 8)?"
Answer: Following the Genesis flood, as the ark was resting on Mount Ararat, Noah released a raven and dove from the ark at different times. The goal in sending these birds was to determine if the flood waters had abated enough for Noah and his family to exit the ark.
In Genesis 8:6-7 we read, “At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made and sent forth a raven. It went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth.” The “40 days” here is after the tops of the mountains were visible (verse 5), over seven months after the flood began. A raven was released and apparently never returned. No reason is provided regarding why a raven was selected rather than another bird. However, raven can eat carrion and would feed off dead animals in the water. A dove, on the other hand, would return to its point of origin if no land was found.
Noah sent a dove in Genesis 8:8-9: “Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground. But the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her and brought her into the ark with him.” The dove returned with no indication that a place had been found to alight.
A week later, in Genesis 8:10-11, Noah sent the dove again: “He waited another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark. And the dove came back to him in the evening, and behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth.” Things had begun to grow once again; the earth was becoming more habitable.
Another week passed. Then, in Genesis 8:12, Noah sends out the dove one more time: “Then he waited another seven days and sent forth the dove, and she did not return to him anymore.” The dove had no need to return to the ark, since it had found a home on land. The ark could soon be emptied, and humanity could begin to establish itself again in the world.
From Genesis 7:11 to 8:14, we know that the flood lasted a total of one year and ten days. The raven and the dove were released over a period of 21 days after the mountaintops became visible (Genesis 8:10-12). The raven served as a first attempt to discover dry land, and the dove became Noah’s way of determining when to leave the ark.
Question:
What bird was first released by Noah?
Answer:
Corbies
Passage:
Porridge (film)
Porridge is a film released in 1979 and based on the television series Porridge. It was released under the title Doing Time in the United States. All the warders and inmates from the original series appear in the film, with the notable exceptions of Lukewarm, Heslop and Harris. There is also a different governor, played by Geoffrey Bayldon.

The film, set a year before the final episode of the TV series, includes one of the last appearances by Richard Beckinsale, the actor who played Godber. He died in March 1979, a few weeks after its completion.

Plot

When new prison officer Beale (Christopher Godwin) suggests that Slade Prison set up an inmates versus celebrities football match, Fletcher (Ronnie Barker) becomes the prison team's manager. The match proves the ideal situation for newly arrived violent armed robber Oakes (Barrie Rutter) to escape. The escape is arranged by Grouty (Peter Vaughan), the prison's Mr. Big, who forces Fletcher to put Oakes in the prison team.

The celebrity team arrive in a coach and during the match Oakes feigns an injury and is taken to the changing rooms where he meets an accomplice, the driver of the coach. They then exchange clothes and Oakes ties the coach driver up. Shortly after Godber (Richard Beckinsale) is concussed and Fletch takes him to the changing rooms. Oakes forces Fletcher and Godber into the coach's luggage compartment at gunpoint and drives out of the prison on the pretext of topping up the fuel.

Oakes meets further accomplices and all three then drive off in another vehicle. The escape is detected but Fletch says he doesn't want to be out as both he and Godber only have a short amount of time to serve. Oakes releases them and Godber and Fletch manage to get back to the coach, which is about to be driven back to the prison. At the prison both convicts slip out of the coach and smuggle themselves in the prison officers' club's store cupboard where they are later found, drunk.

* Jackie Pallo Jr. as Jacko

Production

Unlike the television episodes, the film is not a BBC production and there are no references to the corporation on the DVD release (2003).

The budget for the film was £250,000 and it was backed by Lew Grade's company ITC Entertainment. It was shot mainly on location at Chelmsford Prison, Essex, which was unoccupied at the time because it was being refurbished after a fire in one of the wings. The escape sequence was filmed in Buckinghamshire, and Boxley, Kent. There is also a brief shot of the gates of Maidstone Prison. Sets were constructed for some cell and kitchen scenes.

Most of the filming took place in freezing conditions in January 1979. The resulting delays to the filming schedule meant that the part written for Tony Osoba had to be reduced because he had a commitment to appear in Charles Endell Esquire and his lines were given to other actors.

Trivia

The character "Lotterby", played by Zoot Money, is a nod to Sydney Lotterby, the producer-director of the original BBC Television show Porridge, broadcast between 1974 and 1977.

When Fletcher unwillingly becomes trainer of the prison team he comments that a lifetime of supporting Leyton Orient (football club) has made him disillusioned with the game. In the BBC Television series Fletcher periodically refers to supporting Tottenham Hotspur.

It was the death of Richard Beckinsale just two weeks after the end of shooting that brought an end to any further Porridge projects.

Music

The opening credits of the film feature the hit "Without You" by Nilsson and "Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick" by Ian Dury and the Blockheads. The closing credits contain a more upbeat song by Joe Brown, entitled "Free Inside".

Passage:
Bronze medal
A bronze medal in sports and other similar areas involving competition is a medal made of bronze awarded to the third-place finisher of contests or  competitions such as the Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, etc. The outright winner receives a gold medal and the second place a silver medal. More generally, bronze is traditionally the most common metal used for all types of high-quality medals, including artistic ones.  The practice of awarding bronze third place medals began at the 1904 Olympic Games in St. Louis, Missouri, prior to which only first and second places were awarded.

Olympic Games

Minting Olympic medals is the responsibility of the host city. From 1928–1968 the design was always the same: the obverse showed a generic design by Florentine artist Giuseppe Cassioli with text giving the host city; the reverse showed another generic design of an Olympic champion. From 1972–2000, Cassioli's design (or a slight reworking) remained on the obverse with a custom design by the host city on the reverse. Noting that Cassioli's design showed a Roman amphitheatre for what was originally a Greek game, a new obverse design was commissioned for the Athens 2004 Games. Winter Olympics medals have been of more varied design.

In a few tournament sports, such as boxing, judo, taekwondo and wrestling, two bronze medals are awarded in each event – one for each eliminated semi-finalist or for the winners of the repechage brackets.

Psychological study

In 1995, a study was carried out by social psychologists Victoria Medvec, Scott Madey and Thomas Gilovich on the effects of counterfactual thinking on the Olympics. The study showed that athletes who won the bronze medal were significantly happier with their winning than those athletes who won the silver medal. The silver medalists were more frustrated because they had missed the gold medal, while the bronze medalists were simply happy to have received any honors at all (instead of no medal for fourth place). 
This is more pronounced in knockout competitions, where the bronze medals are achieved by winning a playoff, whereas silver medals are awarded after a defeat in the final.
This psychological phenomenon was parodied in the Jerry Seinfeld special I'm Telling You for the Last Time.

Passage:
Okta
In meteorology, an okta is a unit of measurement used to describe the amount of cloud cover at any given location such as a weather station. Sky conditions are estimated in terms of how many eighths of the sky are covered in cloud, ranging from 0 oktas (completely clear sky) through to 8 oktas (completely overcast). In  addition, in the SYNOP code there is an extra cloud cover indicator '9' indicating that the sky is totally obscured (i.e. hidden from view), usually due to dense fog or heavy snow.

When used in weather charts, okta measurements are shown by means of graphic symbols (rather than numerals) contained within weather circles, to which are attached further symbols indicating other measured data such as wind speed and wind direction. 

Although relatively straightforward to measure (visually, for instance, by using a mirror ), oktas only estimate cloud cover in terms of the area of the sky covered by clouds. They do not account for cloud type or thickness, and this limits their use for estimating cloud albedo or surface solar radiation receipt.

Cloud oktas can also be measured using satellite imagery from geostationary satellites equipped with high-resolution image sensors such as Himawari-8. Similar to traditional approaches, satellite images do not account for cloud composition.

Oktas are often referenced in aviation weather forecasts and low level forecasts: SKC sky clear; FEW 
 1 to 2 oktas; SCT 3 to 4 oktas; BKN 
 5 to 7 oktas; OVC 8 oktas; NSC 
 nil significant cloud; CAVOK = ceiling and visibility okay.
Question:
Okta is a unit measurement of what?
Answer:

Passage:
Herb
In general use, herbs are any plants used for food, flavoring, medicine, or perfume etc. Culinary use typically distinguishes herbs from spices.  Herbs refer to the leafy green parts of a plant (either fresh or dried), while a "spice" is a product from another part of the plant (usually dried), including seeds, berries, bark, roots and fruits.

In botanical English, the word "herb" is also used as a synonym of "herbaceous plant".

Herbs have a variety of uses including culinary, medicinal, and in some cases, spiritual. General usage of the term "herb" differs between culinary herbs and medicinal herbs.  In medicinal or spiritual use any of the parts of the plant might be considered "herbs", including leaves, roots, flowers, seeds, resin, root bark, inner bark (and cambium), berries and sometimes the pericarp or other portions of the plant.

The word "herb" is pronounced in the UK,  but is common among North American speakers and those from other regions where h-dropping occurs.

History 

As far back as 5000 BCE, Sumerians used herbs in medicine.  Ancient Egyptians used fennel, coriander and thyme around 1555 BCE. In ancient Greece, in 162 CE, a physician by the name of Galen was known for concocting complicated herbal remedies that contained up to 100 ingredients.

Culinary herbs

Culinary herbs are distinguished from vegetables in that, like spices, they are used in small amounts and provide flavor rather than substance to food.

Culinary herbs can come in two different forms. They can be in their natural state which is straight from the garden or bought in store, however once they are removed from the main plant they have a life expectancy of around one week if they are refrigerated. Then there is dried herbs, this form of herb is a much more concentrated than if it is fresh, these herbs can be kept anywhere from 6–12 months in a cool dark place.BBC. (2016). Food Ingredients – Herbs. Retrieved from http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/herb

Herbs can be perennials such as thyme or lavender, biennials such as parsley, or annuals like basil. Perennial herbs can be shrubs such as rosemary, Rosmarinus officinalis, or trees such as bay laurel, Laurus nobilis – this contrasts with botanical herbs, which by definition cannot be woody plants. Some plants are used as both herbs and spices, such as dill weed and dill seed or coriander leaves and seeds. Also, there are some herbs such as those in the mint family that are used for both culinary and medicinal purposes.

Medicinal herbs

Some plants contain phytochemicals that have effects on the body.  There may be some effects when consumed in the small levels that typify culinary "spicing", and some herbs are toxic in larger quantities. For instance, some types of herbal extract, such as the extract of St. John's-wort (Hypericum perforatum) or of kava (Piper methysticum) can be used for medical purposes to relieve depression and stress. However, large amounts of these herbs may lead to toxic overload that may involve complications, some of a serious nature, and should be used with caution.

Herbs have long been used as the basis of traditional Chinese herbal medicine, with usage dating as far back as the first century CE  and far before. In India, the Ayurveda medicinal system is based on herbs.  Medicinal use of herbs in Western cultures has its roots in the Hippocratic (Greek) elemental healing system, based on a quaternary elemental healing metaphor. Famous herbalist of the Western tradition include Avicenna (Persian), Galen (Roman), Paracelsus (German Swiss), Culpepper (English) and the botanically inclined  Eclectic physicians of 19th century/early 20th century America (John Milton Scudder, Harvey Wickes Felter, John Uri Lloyd). Modern pharmaceuticals had their origins in crude herbal medicines, and to this day, some drugs are still extracted as fractionate/isolate compounds from raw herbs and then purified to meet pharmaceutical standards.

Certain herbs contain psychoactive properties that have been used for both religious and recreational purposes by humans since the early Holocene era, notably the leaves and extracts of the cannabis and coca plants. The leaves of the coca plant have been chewed by people in northern Peruvian societies for over 8,000 years,  while the use of cannabis as a psychoactive substance dates back to the first century CE in China and northern Africa. 

The indigenous peoples of Australia developed herbal medicine based on plants that were readily available to them. The isolation of the indigenous people meant the remedies developed were for far less serious diseases, this was from not contracting western illnesses. Herbs such as river mint, wattle and eucalyptus were used for coughs, diarrhea, fever and headaches.

Sacred herbs

Herbs are used in many religions.  For example, myrrh (Commiphora myrrha) and frankincense (Boswellia species) in Hellenistic religion, the nine herbs charm in Anglo-Saxon paganism, neem (Azadirachta indica) leaves, bael (Aegele marmelos) leaves, holy basil or tulsi (Ocimum tenuiflorum), turmeric or "haldi" (Curcuma longa), and cannabis in Hinduism. Rastafari also consider cannabis to be a holy plant.

Siberian shamans also used herbs for spiritual purposes. Plants may be used to induce spiritual experiences for rites of passage, such as vision quests in some Native American cultures. The Cherokee Native Americans use both white sage and cedar for spiritual cleansing and smudging.

Herbal cosmetics 

The use of herbal cosmetics dates back to around six centuries ago in the European and Western countries. Mixtures and pastes were often concocted to whiten the face. During the 1940s, herbal cosmetics took a turn with the emerging red lipstick color, with every year gaining a more intense red. Herbal cosmetics come in many forms, such as face creams, scrubs, lipstick, natural fragrances, and body oils.

Passage:
Saskia van Uylenburgh
Saskia van Uylenburgh (August 2, 1612 – June 14, 1642) was the wife of painter Rembrandt van Rijn. In the course of her life she was his model for some of his paintings, drawings and etchings. She was the daughter of a Frisian mayor.

Asteroid 461 Saskia is named in her honour.

Life

Saskia was born in Leeuwarden, Friesland, the youngest of the eight children of Sjoukje Ozinga and Rombertus van Uylenburgh, a top lawyer, a town burgomaster, and one of the founders of the University of Franeker. Saskia (called Saske in Friesland) was orphaned by age 12, as her mother died in 1619 and her father five years later. Supposedly she met Rembrandt at the home of her uncle, Hendrick van Uylenburgh, a painter and art dealer who had emigrated from Friesland to Kraków in Poland with his parents but decided in 1625 to move to the Dutch Republic, where there was growing tolerance after the death of Maurice of Orange.

Saskia was raised by her sister Hiskje and her husband, Gerard van Loo, a lawyer and secretary in the grietenij Het Bildt. For a while she lived in Franeker when her sister Antje was ill. After Antje's burial, Saskia assisted her brother-in-law, the Polish theology professor Johannes Maccovius, until she married Rembrandt in 1634. 

In 1631 and in the company of the Mennonite painters Govert Flinck and Jacob Backer,  Saskia traveled to Amsterdam. There she met Rembrandt, who produced paintings and portraits for Uylenburgh's Amsterdam clients.  
In turn Rembrandt travelled to Leeuwarden, where he was received by the painter Wybrand de Geest, who had married Saskia's niece.

Saskia and Rembrandt were engaged in 1633, and on 10 June 1634 Rembrandt asked permission to marry in Sint Annaparochie. He showed his mother's written consent to the schepen. On 2 July the couple married. The preacher was Saskia's cousin, but evidently none of Rembrandt's family attended the marriage. That Saskia fell in love with an artist who was socially no match for the daughter of a patrician and that she pressed for a speedy betrothal against all conventions certainly shows that she was a very strong and independent character.  In 1635 the couple moved to one of the most desirable addresses in Amsterdam, the Nieuwe Doelenstraat, with prominent neighbors and a view of the river Amstel.

Rembrandt gained financial success through his artwork, and decided in 1639 to buy a house in the Jodenbreestraat, next to the place where he worked. A year before, by July 16, 1638, Saskia's Friesian relatives complained that Saskia was spoiling her inheritance. Rembrandt asked his brother-in-law Ulricus van Uylenburgh, also a lawyer, to help them out, confirming he was successful and able to pay for the house. 

Three of their children died shortly after birth and were buried in the nearby Zuiderkerk. The sole survivor was Titus, who was named after his mother's sister Titia (Tietje) van Uylenburgh. Saskia died the year after he was born, in Amsterdam, aged 29, probably from tuberculosis. She was buried in the Oude Kerk.  For ten years Rembrandt focused on drawings and etchings.

Saskia allowed Rembrandt to use their son's inheritance as long as he did not remarry. If Titus died without issue, Rembrandt would be the heir of the moveable property.  Rembrandt hired Geertje Dircx as a wetnurse; in 1649 she expected him to marry her. The next year Rembrandt had her locked up in a house of correction when Hendrickje Stoffels  became his new housekeeper and mistress. In 1662 Rembrandt, having been in financial trouble for several years, sold Saskia's grave. Hendrickje died the following year.

Multilingual is another possibility, but doesn't exclude the speaker from knowing more than three languages. There is no term I'm aware of that would refer to a group of speakers that are fluent in "only 2 or 3" and this distinction may be too arbitrary to warrant a specific term (at least in common use). It would be like asking for a word for someone fluent in "only six or seven" languages. It's a somewhat arbitrary grouping. –  Zairja Sep 4 '12 at 18:30

Bi-glot is wrong, because you’re used the Latin prefix on the Greek suffix.
It should be diglot (also occasionally spelled di-glott in the 19th century), which the OED reports is a noun and an adjective meaning:
Using or containing two languages, bilingual; expressed or written in two languages; also as sb. A diglot book or version (cf. polyglot).
There is also a corresponding triglot for three.
Most diglots and triglots are Bibles, not people.
So biglot would be a diglot word? :) –  datageist Sep 4 '12 at 22:19

Wikipedia opines that polyglot is in fact a valid word in these circumstances, and for a speaker of many languages there is the word hyperpolyglot. It also says that for two languages or three languages, bilingual and trilingual do “fit the bill”. Multilingual fits too, although I think I would prefer to reserve that for more than three languages since there is a word trilingual.
However, -lingual is an adjectival form and you would have to describe someone as being bilingual or a bilingual person. Bilinguist doesn’t really work, and nor does diglot (you would need the Greek di- prefix to use with -glot).
One might coin the words oligoglot or paucilinguist for someone who can speak a few languages, but I don’t think either will catch on.
So if you don't want to use bilingual then you are left with polyglot and multilingual.

What I meant by my comment was: Dictionaries attest to previous usage (possibly even only a single occasion). They don't necessarily say what is actually widely used in practice, as we are continually being told in this site. I contend that, OUP notwithstanding, bilingual would be distinctly odd as a noun. Perhaps that's another transatlantic difference. –  Andrew Leach♦ Sep 5 '12 at 9:19

@ЯegDwight To be fair, from the original question, it wasn't clear whether Gautam was familiar with the term "trilingual" and only afterward did the question explicitly ask for a -glot word. I think it was an attempt to fill in the blank since there is no word for someone who knows "only 2 or 3" languages (a person can either know only 2 or only 3) and the word for someone fluent in two languages was already given. Merriam-Webster and Collins English Dictionary define triglot as "a book or edition in three languages", but it's easy to extend this to speakers. I gave +1 to both answers. –  Zairja Sep 5 '12 at 11:30

Passage:
Fascinator
A fascinator is a headpiece, a style of millinery. Fascinators were originally a type of lightweight knitted head-covering. Since the 1990s the term refers to a form of formal headwear worn as an alternative to the hat; it is usually a large decorative design attached to a band or clip, sometimes incorporating a base to resemble a miniature hat, in which case it may be called a hatinator.

History 

In the 19th century, a fascinator was a lightweight hood or scarf worn about the head and tied under the chin, typically knitted or crocheted.  It was made from soft, lightweight yarns and may originally have been called a "cloud."  The "cloud" is described in 1870 as being "a light scarf of fine knitting over the head and round the neck, [worn] instead of an opera hood when going out at night."  The fascinator went out of fashion in the 1930s, by which time it described a lacy hood similar to a "fussy balaclava."

The use of the term "fascinator" to describe a particular form of late 20th- and early 21st-century millinery emerged towards the end of the late 20th century, possibly as a term for 1990s designs inspired by the small 1960s cocktail hats designed to perch upon the highly coiffed hairstyles of the period. Although they did not give the style its name, the milliners Stephen Jones and Philip Treacy are credited with having popularised and established fascinators.

Uses

Today, a fascinator may be worn instead of a hat on occasions where hats were traditionally worn—such as weddings—or as an evening accessory, when it may be called a cocktail hat. It is generally worn with fairly formal attire. 

A substantial fascinator is a fascinator of some size or bulk. Bigger than a barrette, modern fascinators are commonly made with feathers, flowers or beads.   They need to be attached to the hair by a comb, headband or clip. They are particularly popular at premium horse-racing events, such as the Grand National, Kentucky Derby and the Melbourne Cup. Brides may choose to wear them as an alternative to a bridal veil or hat, particularly if their gowns are non-traditional.

At the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in April 2011, various female guests arrived wearing fascinators. Among them was Princess Beatrice of York, who wore a piece designed by the Irish milliner Philip Treacy. The unusual shape and colour caused quite a media stir and went on to become an internet phenomenon with its own Facebook page.   Princess Beatrice used the publicity to auction it off on eBay, where it garnered 99,000 euros for charity.  

In 2012 Royal Ascot announced that women will have to wear hats, not fascinators, as part of a tightening of the dress code in Royal Ascot's Royal Enclosure.  In previous years female racegoers were simply advised that "many ladies wear hats." 

Hatinator 

The term hatinator, which emerged in the early 2010s, is used to describe headgear that combines the features of a hat and a fascinator.  The particular style of headgear favoured by Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, is sometimes described as a hatinator.

Charles-Camille Saint-Saëns
Biography
Charles-Camille Saint-Saëns (1835-1921) was a French composer, organist and conductor who wrote works including Rondo Capriccioso, Samson and Delilah and Symphony No.3 'Organ'.
Life and music
Born in Paris in 1835, the son of an audit clerk and carpenter’s daughter, Saint-Saëns showed signs of exceptional musical ability from infancy.
He gave his first private concert to an audience at the tender age of five, started seriously composing the following year, and aged 10 gave his professional debut with an orchestra playing a Mozart concerto and the first movement of Beethoven’s C minor Concerto.
Saint-Saëns was one of the most gifted polymaths in musical history. Quite apart from his exceptional skills as a musician – composer, virtuoso pianist/organist, conductor, distinguished pedagogue – he was also a multi-linguist, a consulted authority on literature and the arts in general, a notable author and poet in his own right, and could hold his own with experts in a whole variety of ‘spare-time’ disciplines, notably archaeology and astronomy.
His most notable work of all is the Danse Macabre (1874), a cornucopia of demonic delight, featuring a scordatura (unconventionally tuned) solo violin, a xylophone making bloodcurdling skeletal noises and a grotesque dance of death silenced only by the sound of the oboe announcing the dawn’s arrival.
Tragically, Saint-Saëns’ two sons both died young.
The most distinguished French composer of his generation, Saint-Saëns selflessly promoted the music of his younger contemporaries, as well as editing works by Gluck, Rameau and Mozart.
Saint-Saëns died in Algiers aged 86.
Did you know?
Saint-Saëns could sightread scores of mind-boggling complexity perfectly at first sight. Wagner, who had little time for anyone but himself, was dumbfounded when Saint-Saëns played through several of his epic operatic scores at the piano as though it was child’s play.

Edward Norton Lorenz
Edward Norton Lorenz (May 23, 1917 – April 16, 2008)   was an American mathematician, meteorologist, and a pioneer of chaos theory.  He introduced the strange attractor notion and coined the term butterfly effect.

Biography

Lorenz was born in West Hartford, Connecticut.  He studied mathematics at both Dartmouth College in New Hampshire and Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  From 1942 until 1946, he served as a meteorologist for the United States Army Air Corps. After his return from World War II, he decided to study meteorology. Lorenz earned two degrees in the area from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he later was a professor for many years. He was a Professor Emeritus at MIT from 1987 until his death.

During the 1950s, Lorenz became skeptical of the appropriateness of the linear statistical models in meteorology, as most atmospheric phenomena involved in weather forecasting are non-linear. His work on the topic culminated in the publication of his 1963 paper "Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow" in Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, and with it, the foundation of chaos theory.

He states in that paper:

His description of the butterfly effect followed in 1969.
   
He was awarded the Kyoto Prize for basic sciences, in the field of earth and planetary sciences, in 1991,  the Buys Ballot Award in 2004, and the Tomassoni Award in 2008.
 
In his later years, he lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was an avid outdoorsman, who enjoyed hiking, climbing, and cross-country skiing. He kept up with these pursuits until very late in his life, and managed to continue most of his regular activities until only a few weeks before his death. According to his daughter, Cheryl Lorenz, Lorenz had "finished a paper a week ago with a colleague."  On April 16, 2008, Lorenz died at his home in Cambridge at the age of 90, having suffered from cancer.

Work

Lorenz built a mathematical model of the way air moves around in the atmosphere. As Lorenz studied weather patterns he began to realize that the weather patterns did not always behave as predicted. Minute variations in the initial values of variables in his twelve-variable computer weather model (c. 1960, running on an LGP-30 desk computer) would result in grossly divergent weather patterns. This sensitive dependence on initial conditions came to be known as the butterfly effect (it also meant that weather predictions from more than about a week out are generally fairly inaccurate). 

Lorenz went on to explore the underlying mathematics and published his conclusions in a seminal work titled Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow, in which he described a relatively simple system of equations that resulted in a very complicated dynamical object now known as the Lorenz attractor.

Passage:
Leofric, Earl of Mercia
Leofric (died 31 August or 30 September 1057) was an Earl of Mercia. He founded monasteries at Coventry and Much Wenlock. Leofric is most remembered as the husband of Lady Godiva.

Life

Leofric was the son of Leofwine, Ealdorman of the Hwicce, who witnessed a charter in 997 for King Æthelred II. Leofric had three brothers: Northman, Edwin and Godwine. It is likely that Northman is the same as Northman Miles ("Northman the knight") to whom King Æthelred II granted the village of Twywell in Northamptonshire in 1013 .  Northman, according to the Chronicle of Crowland Abbey, the reliability of which is often doubted by historians, says he was a retainer (knight) of Eadric Streona, the Earl of Mercia.Baxter, Earls of Mercia, pp. 29–30, and n. 45 for reference It adds that Northman had been killed upon Cnut's orders along with Eadric and others for this reason. Cnut "made Leofric ealdorman in place of his brother Northman, and afterwards held him in great affection." 

Becoming Earl of Mercia made him one of the most powerful men in the land, second only to the ambitious Earl Godwin of Wessex, among the mighty earls. Leofric may have had some connection by marriage to Ælfgifu of Northampton, the first wife of Cnut, which might help to explain why he was the chief supporter of her son Harold Harefoot against Harthacnut, Cnut's son by Emma of Normandy, when Cnut died in 1035.  However, Harold died in 1040 and was succeeded by his brother Harthacnut, who made himself unpopular by implementing heavy taxation during his short reign. Two of his tax-collectors were killed at Worcester by angry locals. The king was so enraged by this that in 1041 he ordered Leofric and his other earls to plunder and burn the city, and lay waste to the surrounding area.  This command must have sorely tested Leofric, since Worcester was the cathedral city of the Hwicce, his people.

When Harthacnut died suddenly in 1042, he was succeeded by his half-brother Edward the Confessor. Leofric loyally supported Edward when Edward came under threat at Gloucester, from Earl Godwin, in 1051. Leofric and Earl Siward of Northumbria gathered a great army to meet that of Godwin. His advisors counseled Edward that battle would be folly, since there would be important members of the nobility on both sides; the loss of these men, should many die in battle, would leave England open to its enemies. So in the end the issue was resolved by less bloody means: Earl Godwin and his family were outlawed for a time. Earl Leofric's power was then at its height. But in 1055 Leofric's own son Ælfgar was outlawed, "without any fault", says the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. Ælfgar raised an army in Ireland and Wales and brought it to Hereford, where he clashed with the army of Earl Ralph of Herefordshire and severely damaged the town. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle wryly comments "And then when they had done most harm, it was decided to reinstate Earl Ælfgar".

Leofric died in 1057 at his estate at Kings Bromley in Staffordshire. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, he died on 30 September, but the chronicler of Worcester gives the date as 31 August. Both agree that he was buried at Coventry.  Leofric was succeeded by his son Ælfgar as earl.

Religious works

Earl Leofric and Godiva were noted for great generosity to religious houses. In 1043 he founded and endowed a Benedictine monastery at Coventry.[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?doseek&query
S+1226 Anglo-Saxons.net : S 1226] John of Worcester tells us that "He and his wife, the noble Countess Godgifu, a worshipper of God and devout lover of St Mary ever-virgin, built the monastery there from the foundations out of their own patrimony, and endowed it adequately with lands and made it so rich in various ornaments that in no monastery in England might be found the abundance of gold, silver, gems and precious stones that was at that time in its possession."

In the 1050s Leofric and Godiva appear jointly as benefactors in a document granting land to the monastery of St Mary, Worcester,[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?doseek&query
S+1232 Anglo-Saxons.net : S 1232] and the endowment of the minster at Stow St Mary, Lincolnshire.[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?doseek&query
S+1478 Anglo-Saxons.net : S 1478] They are commemorated as benefactors of other monasteries as well, at Leominster, Chester, Much Wenlock, and Evesham.

Family

Apart from Northman, killed in 1017, Leofric had at least two other brothers: Edwin was killed in battle by Gruffydd ap Llywelyn in 1039, and Godwine died some time before 1057.

Leofric may have married more than once. His famous wife Godiva survived him and may have been a second or later wife. Since there is some question about the date of marriage for Leofric and Godgifu (Godiva), it is not clear whether she was the mother of Ælfgar, Leofric's only known child. If Godiva was married to Earl Leofric later than about 1010, she could not have been the mother of Ælfgar. 

Other

Leofric used a double-headed eagle as his personal emblem, and this has been adopted by various units of the British Army as a symbol for Mercia. 

Historians disagree extensively on the character of Leofric. Folklore tends to depict him as an unfeeling overlord who imposed over-taxation, whereas many historians object to this, and consider it as part of the Lady Godiva myth; they suggest that he was a strong and respected leader. There is also great disagreement over his reputation as a military leader: some historians believe Leofric to have been weak in this respect, but others go as far as to give him the title 'Hammer of the Welsh'.

In popular culture

On screen, Leofric was portrayed by Roy Travers in the British silent short Lady Godiva (1928), George Nader in the film Lady Godiva of Coventry (1955), and Tony Steedman in the BBC TV series Hereward the Wake (1965). He also may have inspired “The Last Kingdom” character, “Leofric”.

Cesarewitch Handicap
|}

The Cesarewitch Handicap is a flat handicap horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged three years or older. It is run at Newmarket over a distance of 2 miles and 2 furlongs (3,621 metres), and finishes on the Rowley Mile. It is scheduled to take place each year in October.

History

"Cesarewitch" is an anglicised version of Tsesarevich, the title of the heir to the throne in Imperial Russia. The race was named in honour of Tsesarevich Alexander (later Tsar Alexander II), after he donated £300 to the Jockey Club.

The event was established in 1839, and the inaugural running was won by Cruiskeen. It was founded in the same year as another major handicap at Newmarket, the Cambridgeshire. The two races came to be known as the Autumn Double.

The Cesarewitch initially took place before the Cambridgeshire, but the schedule was later reversed and it is now held two weeks after the other race. Three horses completed the double in the 19th century — Rosebery (1876), Foxhall (1881) and Plaisanterie (1885) — but the feat has been rarely attempted since then.

The race was formerly staged during Newmarket's Champions' Day meeting in mid-October and became part of a new fixture called Future Champions Day in 2011. In 2014 the Cesarewitch was separated from Future Champions Day, which was moved back a week in the calendar, and in 2015 it returned to the Saturday of the new Future Champions Festival.

Passage:
Never the Twain
Never the Twain is a British sitcom that ran for eleven series from 7 September 1981 to 9 October 1991. 

It was created by  Johnnie Mortimer, and was the only sitcom he ever created without his usual writing partner, Brian Cooke. Mortimer wrote the entirety of the first two series, one episode of the seventh, and five out of six episodes of the eighth, with the rest being mainly written by John Kane and Vince Powell (who wrote the whole of the last three series).

The series starred Windsor Davies (of, "It Ain't Half Hot Mum" fame) and the late Donald Sinden as rival antique dealers, and also co-starred Robin Kermode (later replaced by Christopher Morris), Julia Watson (later replaced by Tacy Kneale), Honor Blackman, Teddy Turner, Derek Deadman, Maria Charles and Zara Nutley.

It was made by Thames Television for the ITV network. Since it finished, it has been repeated a few times on satellite television: first on UK Gold and later on ITV3.

The title is taken from the Rudyard Kipling poem; The Ballad of East and West. The show's theme tune was composed by Jack Trombey and the track was entitled Domino.

Plot

Oliver Smallbridge, played by Windsor Davies, and Simon Peel, played by Donald Sinden, are antiques dealers who are also bitter enemies (after a falling-out having been business partners) and next-door neighbours, both in their homes and shops. They are engaged in a continuous game of one-upmanship, so both of them are shocked when they find out that their respective children (Smallbridge's daughter Lyn - played by Watson and later Kneale - and Peel's son David - played by Kermode and later Morris) are in love and want to marry as soon as possible. The fathers are forced to reluctantly accept the relationship and marriage, which takes place at the end of the first series.

It is the impending marriage of Lyn and David and the early days of their marriage, alongside Oliver and Simon battling over the affection of middle-class widow Veronica Barton (played by Blackman), that provides the basis for the first two series (both written entirely by Mortimer). The third series features a failed attempt by Simon and Oliver to try to renew their business partnership.

After the third series, Lyn and David move to Vancouver in Canada, leaving the daily goings on at Simon and Oliver's shops and in their private lives as the main themes of the show. Other notable characters in the series are be Simon's butler Banks (played by Turner), a replacement for a foreign au pair that Simon had requested; Ringo (played by Deadman), Oliver's idiotic assistant in his shop; and Mrs. Sadler (played by Charles), Oliver's clumsy cleaner, who has an annoying tendency to accidentally break things. Banks and Mrs. Sadler's amorous relationship provides humorous material in these series, with both of them marrying and leaving the show at the end of the seventh series. The fourth to seventh series were written by a group of  writers, Powell and Me and My Girl co-creator Kane being the most prominent.

In the eighth series (mostly written again by Mortimer), Lyn and David return from Canada with their son (and Oliver's and Simon's grandson) Martin, who provides a new platform on which Simon and Oliver can develop their long-standing rivalry, fighting over who is the better grandfather. However, at the end of that series, Lyn, David and Martin move to a new flat in Friern Barnet.

Simon and Oliver's daily personal and business lives are the primary focus of the final three series (all written in their entirety by Powell). In these series, another character (who had already made two appearances in series 4 and 7) begins to appear regularly: Simon's Aunt Eleanor (played by Nutley, who had also appeared in Vince Powell's earlier sitcom Mind Your Language), moves near Oliver and Simon.

Also, appearing in some episodes of the series were Donald Sinden's sons Marc and Jeremy, while his wife Diana appeared in the last ever episode. 

DVD releases

The complete first series was released on DVD in June 2001, by Clear Vision and no other series were released. It was announced that a different company will release a DVD featuring the first two series, it was released in September 2010. 

Locations

The outside locations for the two antique shops were filmed in Hersham, Surrey on the site of a restaurant.

Repeats

Beginning in late 2014 the channel ITV3 began showing repeats beginning with series one in a late afternoon timeslot with other classic series such as Rising Damp and On The Buses.

What is the occupation of Oliver Smallbridge, played by Windsor Davies, and Simon Peel, played by Donald Sinden in the long running sitcom Never the Twain?

Passage:
Hospital gown
A hospital gown, also called a johnny gown  or johnny  is "a long loose piece of clothing worn in a hospital by someone doing or having an operation." It can be used as clothing for bedridden patients. 

Utility

Hospital gowns worn by patients are designed so that hospital staff can easily access the part of the patient's body being treated. 

The hospital gown is made of fabric that can withstand repeated laundering in hot water, usually cotton, and is fastened at the back with twill tape ties.  Disposable hospital gowns may be made of paper or thin plastic, with paper or plastic ties.

Some gowns have snaps along the top of the shoulder and sleeves, so that the gown can be removed without disrupting intravenous lines in the patient's arms.

Used paper hospital gowns are associated with hospital infections, which could be avoided by proper disposal. 

A Canadian study surveying patients at five hospitals determined 57 percent could have worn more clothing below the waist, but only 11 percent wore more than a gown. The physicians conducting the survey said gowns should not be required unless they are necessary. Although they are cheaper and easier to wash, Dr. Todd Lee, of Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, said gowns are not necessary unless the patient is incontinent or has an injury in the lower body. Otherwise, Lee said, pajamas or regular clothes may be acceptable. 

Design

In November 2006, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation gave a $236,000 grant to a team at North Carolina State University to design a new gown based on "style, cost, durability, comfort, function" and other qualities. Studies had been done on updating the garment first used when most patients had to stay in bed, but not designed for modesty when patients got out of bed. NCSU professor Traci Lamar said, ""Now doctors want patients up and walking quickly." Still, traditional gowns could be washed many times and could be handled a lot. Lamar's team worked to come up with a "more comfortable, less revealing" design. Surveys found that nurses did not like the ties in the back because knots could form, and some patients wore more than one gown at once, with one tied in front and the other in back. Many patients disliked how lightweight gowns were. In April 2009, the NCSU team showed potential new designs at a reception, and they were preparing to ask for more funding as they developed a prototype. Meanwhile, some hospitals were offering alternatives, including gowns that opened in the front or on the side, and drawstring pants, cotton tops and boxers. These cost more than traditional gowns.

In 2009, Fatima Ba-Alawi was honored for her DCS (dignity, comfort, safety) gown at a RCN conference on London. Four years after she started using her skills making dresses to redesign hospital gowns, NHS trusts were using the design. The reversible gowns have plastic poppers which make it easier to change without moving the patient and save staff time, and side pockets for drips or catheters, along with a pouch for cardio equipment.  One version called the Faith Gown has a detachable head scarf and long sleeves. 

Another redesign in England came from Ben de Lisi, one of six receiving grants. The Design Council was scheduled to show his design, which did not open in the back but did allow access, in March 2010.  

The Cleveland Clinic changed its gowns in 2010 because the CEO had heard many complaints. 

Many patients feel that hospital gowns are unfashionable, Diane von Furstenberg was commissioned to design stylish hospital gowns based on her fashionable wrap dress by the Cleveland Clinic.  The new design was reversible with a V-neck in both the front and the back, with softer fabric.

Joel Sherman in his blog "Adolescent Boys and Genital Exams
Reducing Embarrassment" says it is quite common for many teenage boys to be upset when changing into a hospital gown, especially if the wearer associates the look of the gown to women's clothing, women's nightgowns, or lingerie. 

Lamar's additional funding came from RocketHub. At NCSU Fashion Week in 2013, Lamar's design was mentioned as "functional and dignified," but not shown "to prevent any patent infringements". A prototype, made of DermaFabric and made at Precision Fabrics in Greensboro, North Carolina, was to be tested at WakeMed.

A design patented in 2014 by Janice Fredrickson had a side opening and sleeve openings, and could be put on without the patient sitting up. One version had pockets for telemetry wires and for drainage bags. It was suggested that different colors be used for different patients, such as those at risk of falling. 

In 2015, Henry Ford Health System of Detroit was working on its own design, similar to a bathrobe with cotton blend. In tests, patients liked the new design. But any update was likely to cost more, as well as harder to take care of. The Model G design, to be made by Carhartt of Michigan, used snaps on the front and shoulders.  

According to the BBC, in England hospital gowns are made much more modestly, taking patient dignity into consideration.

10 most extreme places on Earth
A hen party is a festive celebration held before a wedding, and attended by the bride and her female friends. These parties are basically the female equivalent of the male bachelor party or stag party. Known as "bachelorette parties" in the United States, and "stagette parties" in Canada, they are called "hen parties" or "hen nights" in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Australia.
This type of party is usually planned by the brides’ closest friends, often the maid of honor or bridesmaids. The festivities can be held in a public place, such as a restaurant or bar, or may be held in a private home or rented room. The location often depends on the amount of exuberance expected of guests. Some celebrations can get quite wild, with frenzied dancing and inappropriate behavior. Alternately, a day of drinking champagne at a day spa would be considered a tame version.
Unlike a bridal shower with young girls in attendance, the hen party is strictly for adult women. Bringing a gag gift is de rigueur, with lighthearted male-bashing a favorite theme. Gifts are meant to cause a bit of blushing and gales of laughter, if possible. Drinking of alcohol and freeform dancing may be encouraged as the party unfolds. The women will “let down their hair,” but generally watch out for one another to see that no one is ever in danger.
Ad
There is a wide range of options when it comes to planning the entertainment for a hen party. The general idea is to celebrate the last moments of single life and the new life that will unfold. Planners will be wise to listen carefully to the likes and dislikes of the bride, and let the nature of her personality set the tone for the festivities.
An afternoon cocktail party with a few naughty games will suffice for some brides, while others prefer a wild night of dancing and slamming shots. On the other hand, some brides will completely shun the idea of a raucous night of drinking in favor of a spa day with the bridal party, including soothing massages, manicures and pedicures, and other lavish pampering.
The word “hen” in the title is a reference to female chickens. In the U.S., the term is considered somewhat derogatory toward women, and the time of sexual equality, any gathering of women and girls might have been classified as a hen party. The parties held by today's women have nothing to do with the innocent quilting bees of old, except for female bonding.

My hen party was in the UK, I had a party organizer take care of it for me. It wasn't very expensive and they came up with so many unique hen night ideas and activities we could do. I just picked what I like. They organized the whole event and even had free gifts for us. It's worth the trouble to plan yourself in my opinion.

@ysmina-- There are so many fun and naughty hen party games. They're relatively easy to come up with too, just use your imagination.
Locale and food can be the major costs involved with a hen party. But many restaurants offer special fixed price menus for parties. You can even have the party at home if you want to save money.
My sister-in-law did a house party for her hen do and we had a beautician come over and give us facials and makeovers. Then we played games, watched our favorite films, ate and drank. It was a lot of fun, we didn't get stressed out and it was also a sleep-over so no one had to worry about driving home. It was genuinely a great night.

What can I do for a hen night party on a budget?
The attendees will all be adults so it can be a little on the naughty side. I certainly don't want to bore people. It can't be too crazy either though because I don't know some of the ladies who are invited. Please help!

Naughty-shaped piñatas are a fun trend which takes "lighthearted male-bashing..." to a new level.
Papier-mâché or cardboard moulds covered with brightly coloured paper, piñatas are typically filled with sweets and beaten with a stick until the contents come whizzing out.
Fun for a hen party, phallic-shaped goodies, jokes, condoms and sweets are hilarious. Look online for inspiration.

@naturesgurl3 -- Oh wow.  You can really go a lot of directions with hen party accessories.
Kind of like hen parties themselves, the accessories span the spectrum from very innocent to quite naughty.
If you're looking for pretty tame ones, you might consider getting your sister a veil or a fun tiara.  Some places even sell sashes that say "Bride to Be" or "Hen Party".
They also have accessories for the friends, like little bottles of bubbles, t-shirts, boas, you name it.
That way she can feel special, and you guys can have fun without getting too crazy.

Apalachin, New York
Apalachin (; ) is a census-designated place within the Town of Owego in Tioga County, New York, United States. The population was 1,131 in the 2010 census. It is named after the Apalachin Creek. Apalachin means From where the messenger returned in Lenape.

Apalachin is in the southeast part of the Town of Owego and is west of Binghamton, New York. It is also part of the Binghamton Metropolitan Statistical Area.

History 

The first settler arrived around 1786, but the community was not founded until 1836. 

On November 14, 1957, the heads of the American Mafia held the Apalachin Meeting at the home of Joseph Barbara, a conference of mobsters who had gathered to iron out various issues in the underworld. The gathering was quickly broken up when a curious New York State Trooper turned up and sent some of the most powerful gangsters in the country fleeing through the surrounding countryside. Mafiosi and the FBI sometimes just refer to the meeting as Apalachin. This meeting was humorously portrayed in the ending sequence of the 1999 motion picture Analyze This, which starred Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal. This meeting was also referenced in Goodfellas by narrator Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), and fully depicted in the 1972  movie The Valachi Papers.

Apalachin hosts the annual Apalachin Firemens Field Days for four days generally the first week in June.  This event began in the late 1950s and has grown from a small event in a field to having a permanent location with large pavilions (still called the beer and food tents by locals) and a large square of game booths that surround 15-20 carnival rides. Events include the Little Miss Apalachin contest, fireworks and a large parade. Profits from the event allow the fire department to purchase equipment for its volunteer force.

Riverside Cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.

England: All-time football records

England is where football began with some of the same rules used in the modern game first created by the original Football Association. And since, the Three Lions have always been a power house in international football.
In tournaments, they have always been a threat to their opposition. England have won the World Cup in 1966 and their best result in European Championships came in 1968 when they beat Soviet Union in the third place play-off after losing to Yugoslavia in the semifinal.
The England football crest
Here are ten of the all-time greatest record of the England national football team:
Biggest win
You have to go back as far as 1882 to find England’s biggest win which was a 13-0 thumping of Ireland.
England put 13 past Ireland again in 1899 in a 13-2 win with the next biggest win an 11-1 demolition of Austria in 1908. The youngest big win for England came in 1982 with a 9-0 victory over Luxembourg at Wembley.
Worst defeat
The biggest defeat that England have ever suffered is a 7-1 loss against the great Hungarians in 1954.
England were also beaten 7-2 by Scotland in 1878 and they lost again to the Scots 6-1 just three years later. A defeat to Brazil in 1964 is the most recent heavy defeat with England losing the game 5-1 before winning the World Cup just two years later.
Top scorers
Sir Bobby Charlton is the leading goal scorer for England in international football with 49 goals. He is closely followed by Gary Lineker who retired with 48 goals to his name.
Jimmy Greaves scored 44 times for the Three Lions which is four more than Michael Owen’s 40 goals. Tom Finney heads a list of three players on 30 goals.
Most capped player
Former goalkeeper Peter Shilton has more caps for England than any other player with 125. He also made over 1,000 Football League appearances.
David Beckham is second in the list with 115 England caps, Bobby Moore finished with 108 caps, Sir Bobby Charlton had 106 caps and Billy Wright had 105 caps.
Youngest player
Theo Walcott holds the record for being the youngest ever player to make his full international debut for England aged 17 years and 75 days old. The Arsenal winger made his debut against Hungary on May 30, 2006.
He is also the youngest ever player to score a hat-trick for England at 19 years and 178 days of age – he scored three against Croatia on September 10, 2008.
England’s 1966 World Cup triumph
Longest serving manager
Walter Winterbottom holds the record for being England’s longest serving manager as he coached the side for sixteen years between 1946 and 1962.
Sir Alf Ramsey is second on the list with twelve years between 1962 and 1974 as the England boss with Sir Bobby Robson third on the list with a reign of eight years between 1982 and 1990 which ended with World Cup semi-final defeat in his final year.
Foreign coaches
Sven-Goran Eriksson became the first non-English manager of the England national team when he was appointed in 2001. He guided England to many memorable wins including a 5-1 victory away in Germany during his five years as manager.
Fabio Capello became the second foreign coach of England when he took over in 2008.
Penalty shoot-outs
England have lost more penalty shoot-outs at the FIFA World Cup than any other nation. England have lost three shoot-outs in total and have a reputation for being ‘bottlers’ when it comes to deciding matches at big tournaments via the spot kick method.
Red cards
Alan Mullery was the first ever player to be sent off for England in an international match. Mullery was sent off during the 1968 European Championship semi-final defeat against Yugoslavia.
David Beckham and Wayne Rooney share the record for most red cards for England with two each.
Shortest & tallest
The tallest player to ever play for England is Stoke City striker Peter Crouch at six feet seven inches tall.
The shortest player to ever play for England was Fanny Walden, a Tottenham winger who was just five feet two inches tall when he made his full England debut.

Passage:
Chalcocite
Chalcocite, copper(I) sulfide (Cu2S), is an important copper ore mineral. It is opaque and dark-gray to black with a metallic luster. It has a hardness of 2½ - 3 on the Mohs scale.  It is a sulfide with an orthorhombic crystal system.

The term chalcocite comes from the alteration of the obsolete name chalcosine, from the Greek khalkos, meaning copper. It is also known as redruthite, vitreous copper and copper-glance.

Occurrence

Chalcocite is sometimes found as a primary vein mineral in hydrothermal veins. However, most chalcocite occurs in the supergene enriched environment below the oxidation zone of copper deposits as a result of the leaching of copper from the oxidized minerals. It is also often found in sedimentary rocks.

It has been mined for centuries and is one of the most profitable copper ores. The reasons for this is its high copper content (66.6% atomic ratio and nearly 80% by weight) and the ease at which copper can be separated from sulfur. 

Since chalcocite is a secondary mineral that forms from the alteration of other minerals, it has been known to form pseudomorphs of many different minerals. A pseudomorph is a mineral that has replaced another mineral atom by atom, but it leaves the original mineral's crystal shape intact. Chalcocite has been known to form pseudomorphs of the minerals bornite, covellite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, enargite, millerite, galena and sphalerite.
Question:
Chalcocite is an important ore of which metallic element?
Answer:
COPPER
