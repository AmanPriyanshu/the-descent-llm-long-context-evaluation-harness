Passage:
Anything You Can Do (song)
"Anything You Can Do" is a song composed by Irving Berlin for the 1946 Broadway musical, Annie Get Your Gun.   The song is a duet, with one male singer and one female singer attempting to outdo each other in increasingly complex tasks. 

In the musical, the song sets the scene for the climactic sharpshooting contest between Annie Oakley and Frank Butler.  Its most memorable lines are, "Anything you can do I can do better; I can do anything better than you." The song was first performed in Annie Get Your Gun by Ethel Merman and Ray Middleton. 

During the song, they argue playfully about who can, for example, sing softer, sing higher, sing sweeter, and hold a note for longer, and boast of their abilities and accomplishments, such as opening safes and living on bread and cheese, although Annie always seems to counter Frank's argument. Neither can "bake a pie," though.

Passage:
The Wreck of the Hesperus
"The Wreck of the Hesperus" is a narrative poem by American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, first published in Ballads and Other Poems in 1842.  It is a story that presents the tragic consequences of a sea captain's pride.  On an ill-fated voyage in winter, he brings his daughter aboard ship for company. The captain ignores the advice of one of his experienced men, who fears that a hurricane is approaching. When the storm
arrives, the captain ties his daughter to the mast to prevent her from being swept overboard. She calls out to her dying father as she hears the surf beating on the shore, then prays to Christ to calm the seas. The ship crashes onto the reef of Norman's Woe and sinks; the next morning a horrified fisherman finds the daughter's body, still tied to the mast and drifting in the surf. The poem ends with a prayer that all be spared such a fate "on the reef of Norman's Woe."

The poem was published in the New World, edited by Park Benjamin, which appeared on January 10, 1840. Longfellow was paid $25 for it.

Inspiration

Longfellow combined fact and fiction to create this poem. His inspiration was the great Blizzard of 1839, which ravaged the northeast coast of the United States for 12 hours starting January 6, 1839, destroying 20 ships with a loss of 40 lives.  He probably drew specifically on the destruction of the Favorite, a ship from Wiscasset, Maine, on the reef of Norman's Woe off the coast of Gloucester, Massachusetts. All hands were lost, one of which was a woman, who reportedly floated to shore dead but still tied to the mast.   It is, however, possible that this detail was taken from a different ship that foundered during the same storm.
“The Wreck of the Hesperus” is based on two events: an actual shipwreck at Norman’s Woe, after which a body like the one in the poem was found, and the real wreck of the Hesperus, which took place near Boston. Despite that fact, the poem is so well known that the loop road leading close to Norman’s Woe from Route 127 is named Hesperus Ave. 

In December 1839, Longfellow wrote in his diary about the writing of "The Wreck of the Hesperus":

In popular culture

"The Wreck of the Hesperus" was adapted into films of the same name in 1927  and 1948.  In the 1975 Australian film, Picnic at Hanging Rock, the headmistress forbids a student from participating in a school outing because she has failed to memorize lines from the poem. In Kevin Sullivan's 1985 film of Anne of Green Gables, a character recites "The Wreck of the Hesperus" prior to Anne's rousing rendition of "The Highwayman". "The Wreck of the Hesperus" is referenced in the comic song "Lydia the Tattooed Lady" by Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg, performed by Groucho Marx in the movie At the Circus (1939), by Virginia Weidler in The Philadelphia Story (1940),  by Robin Williams in  The Fisher King (1991), as well as Kermit the Frog in The Muppet Show, and in an episode of Homeland (ep. 2x06).

"Lydia the Tattooed Lady", Groucho Marx's signature song, places the Wreck of the Hesperus on Lydia's back, next to the Battle of Waterloo.  The enchanting Lydia once swept an Admiral clear off his feet. The ships on her hips made his heart skip a beat, And now the old boy's in command of the fleet, For he went and married Lydia.

The title phrase is sometimes used colloquially to indicate a disheveled appearance. In the film The Big Circus (1959), one character tells another: "I didn't bring the rain and you're beginning to look like the wreck of the Hesperus."

The Pleasure Island amusement park in Wakefield, Massachusetts (1958 - 1970), 18 miles south-west of the site where the fictional Hesparus sank, featured a ride named "The Wreck of the Hesperus". 

The rock band Procol Harum included their song "The Wreck of the Hesperus" on their album A Salty Dog, released in 1969. George Harrison included his song "Wreck of the Hesperus" on his 1987 album Cloud Nine. The English poet Roger McGough recited a one-minute version of the poem, complete with sound effects, on the album "Miniatures" produced by Morgan Fisher in 1980.

Mad magazine parodied the poem by presenting the text with outlandish illustrations by Wallace Wood, including a pint-sized captain and a hideous, tall daughter, who survives the storms and strides away still tied to the mast.

Wreck of the Hesperus is the name of an Irish doom/drone metal band.

Although identical in nearly every respect to the initiation rites of "Crossing the Desert" and the "Unblinking Eye", the "Wreck of the Hesperus" is a possibly superfluous ordeal suffered by Homer Simpson as part of his acceptance into the secret society of Stonecutters. The ordeal requires that the initiate walk a line blindfolded while other Stonecutters swiftly strike the initiate's buttocks with cricket bats. It is generally the penultimate trial, followed only by the ordeal "The Paddling of the Swollen Ass (with Paddles)".

Passage:
Ave Maria (Schubert)
"" ("", D. 839, Op. 52, No. 6, 1825), in English: "Ellen's Third Song", was composed by Franz Schubert in 1825 as part of his Opus 52, a setting of seven songs from Walter Scott's popular epic poem The Lady of the Lake, loosely translated into German.

It has become one of Schubert's most popular works, recorded by a wide variety and large number of singers, under the title of "Ave Maria", in arrangements with various lyrics which commonly differ from the original context of the poem. It was arranged in three versions for piano by Franz Liszt.

The Lady of the Lake and the "Ave Maria"

The piece was composed as a setting of a song (verse XXIX from Canto Third) from Walter Scott's popular epic poem The Lady of the Lake,  in a German translation by  (1780–1822),  and thus forms part of Schubert's '. In Scott's poem the character Ellen Douglas, the Lady of the Lake (Loch Katrine in the Scottish Highlands), has gone with her exiled father to stay in the Goblin's cave as he has declined to join their previous host, Roderick Dhu, in rebellion against King James. Roderick Dhu, the chieftain of Clan Alpine, sets off up the mountain with his warriors, but lingers and hears the distant sound of the harpist Allan-bane, accompanying Ellen who sings a prayer addressed to the Virgin Mary, calling upon her for help. Roderick Dhu pauses, then goes on to battle. 

Schubert's arrangement is said to have first been performed at the castle of Countess Sophie Weissenwolff in the little Austrian town of Steyregg and dedicated to her, which led to her becoming known as "the lady of the lake" herself. 

The opening words and refrain of Ellen's song, namely "Ave Maria" (Latin for "Hail Mary"), may have led to the idea of adapting Schubert's melody as a setting for the full text of the traditional Roman Catholic prayer "Ave Maria". The Latin version of the "Ave Maria" is now so frequently used with Schubert's melody that it has led to the misconception that he originally wrote the melody as a setting for the "Ave Maria".

Position within the cycle

In 1825, Schubert composed a selection of seven songs from Scott's The Lady of the Lake. They were published in 1826 as his Opus 52.

The songs are not intended for a single performer: the three songs of Ellen are piano songs for a woman's voice, while the songs for Norman and the Count of Douglas were intended for the baritone Johann Michael Vogl. The remaining two songs are written one for a male and the other for a female ensemble.

# "Ellens Gesang I", D. 837, Raste Krieger, Krieg ist aus / "Soldier rest! the warfare o’er"
# "Ellens Gesang II", D. 838, Jäger, ruhe von der Jagd / "Huntsman, rest! thy chase is done"
# "Bootgesang", D. 835, Triumph, er naht / "Hail to the chief", for male voice quartet
# "Coronach" (Deathsong of the women and girls), D. 836, Er ist uns geschieden / "He is gone to the mountain", for female choir
# "Normans Gesang", D. 846, Die Nacht bricht bald herein ("Night will soon be falling")
# "Ellens Gesang III" (Hymn to the Virgin), D. 839, Ave Maria! Jungfrau mild! / "Ave Maria! maiden mild!"
# "Lied des gefangenen Jägers", D. 843, Mein Roß so müd / "My steed is tired"

Schubert composed the songs to the German texts. However, with the exception of No. 5, the songs were clearly intended to be published with the original English texts as well. This meant finding correspondences to Storck's sometimes quite free translations, which entailed significant difficulties.

Lyrics

Use in Disney's Fantasia

Walt Disney used Schubert's song in the final part of his 1940 film Fantasia, where he linked it to Modest Mussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain in one of his most famous pastiches. The end of Mussorgsky's work blends with almost no break into the beginning of Schubert's song, and as Deems Taylor remarked, the bells in Night on Bald Mountain, originally meant to signal the coming of dawn, which cause the demon Chernobog to stop his dark worship and the ghosts to return to the grave, now seem to be church bells signalling the beginning of religious services. A procession of monks is shown walking along. The text for this version is sung in English, and was written by Rachel Field.  This version also had three stanzas, like Schubert's original, but only the third stanza made it into the film (one line in the last stanza is partially repeated to show how it is sung in the film):

The version heard in Fantasia was arranged by Leopold Stokowski especially for the film, and unlike the original, which is for a solo voice, is scored for soprano and mixed chorus, accompanied by the string section of the Philadelphia Orchestra. The soloist is Julietta Novis. The Ave Maria sequence was later featured in Very Merry Christmas Songs, which is part of Disney Sing-Along Songs, as a background movie for the song Silent Night.

Passage:
Veronica Lario
Veronica Lario (born on 19 July 1956 as Miriam Raffaella Bartolini) is a former Italian actress and the former wife of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.

Biography

Born in Bologna, Lario was an actress in low-budget films. She also worked in theatrical plays with well-known actors; she retired from acting after meeting Silvio Berlusconi.

Married on 15 December 1990, Berlusconi and Lario have three children together: Barbara Berlusconi (1984),At this time Silvio Berlusconi was still married to Carla Elvira Lucia Dall'Oglio, from whom he was divorced in 1985. Eleonora (1986), and Luigi (1988). In the 80s, before the birth of the first-born daughter Barbara, Lario terminated an earlier pregnancy with an induced abortion, in order not to give birth to a child affected by significant morbidity. 

As the wife of the Italian premier, Veronica Lario has chosen to maintain a low public profile. She has avoided most public events and meetings and she seldom accompanies her husband Silvio Berlusconi at official meetings. On the other hand, she has been known to have publicly expressed political opinions contrasting with those of her husband (for example, on bioethics or in backing for protesters demonstrating against the war in Iraq ).

Lario's husband was never shy about mentioning her on public occasions, and he has alluded at least once to a supposed affair between her and opposition politician Massimo Cacciari.While the supposed affair was only mentioned in gossip tabloids, on October 2002, during a press conference with Danish prime minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Silvio Berlusconi said he ought to introduce his wife to Rasmussen, "the best-looking prime minister in Europe and certainly more handsome than Cacciari". See also [http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,,1005001,00.html the Guardian] on this episode.

On 31 January 2007, Lario said her dignity had been damaged by comments Berlusconi reportedly made during the VIP party after a TV awards ceremony broadcast by one of his channels.

"If I weren't married I would marry you immediately", the 70-year-old media mogul told showgirl and future parliamentarian Mara Carfagna, according to reports widely carried in the Italian press. He reportedly told another, "With you, I'd go anywhere".

Lario's letter appeared in La Repubblica, a nationally prominent newspaper. She declared:

I see these statements as damaging my dignity. To both my husband and the public man, I therefore demand a public apology, since I haven't received any privately. I have faced the inevitable contrasts and the more painful moments that a long conjugal relation entails with respect and discretion.

"Now I write to state my reaction," added Lario, saying her husband's comments were "unacceptable" and could not be reduced to mere jokes.

But after few hours, Silvio Berlusconi wrote back a public letter to his wife and apologized for what he had said three days before.

In April 2009 she once more published an open letter, criticising her husband for consorting with young ladies  and defining his chosen candidates for the European Parliament as "shameless rubbish".

On 3 May 2009 it was reported that she is to file for divorce,  which under Italian law can only be started after a couple has reached a separation agreement. On 10 May 2010 it was revealed that a separation settlement had been reached, with Berlusconi accepting alimony payments of €3,6 million per year, and allowing her to live in their luxury home near Milan. 

In December 2012 Milan court established that Silvio Berlusconi will pay his ex-wife Veronica Lario €3 million a month (36 million a year).

Veronica Lario was much in the news as the angry wife of which womanising European leader?

Passage:
Wedding anniversary
A wedding anniversary is the anniversary of the date a marriage took place. Traditional names exist for all of them: for instance, 50 years of marriage is called a "golden wedding anniversary" or simply a "golden anniversary." Twenty-five years is called a "silver wedding anniversary" or "silver anniversary." Sixty years is a "diamond wedding anniversary" or  "diamond anniversary". First year anniversary is called a "Paper Anniversary."

Official recognition

The historic origins of wedding anniversaries date back to the Holy Roman Empire, when husbands crowned their wives with a silver wreath on their twenty-fifth anniversary, and a gold wreath on the fiftieth. Later, principally in the twentieth century, commercialism led to the addition of more anniversaries being represented by a named gift. 

In the Commonwealth realms, one can receive a message from the monarch for 60th, 65th, and 70th wedding anniversaries, and any wedding anniversary after that.  This is done by applying to Buckingham Palace in the United Kingdom, or to the Governor-General's office in the other Commonwealth realms. 

In Australia, where one can receive a letter of congratulations from the Governor-General on the 50th and all subsequent wedding anniversaries; the Prime Minister, the federal Opposition leader, local members of both state and federal parliaments, and state Governors may also send salutations for the same anniversaries. 

In Canada, one can also receive a message from the Governor-General for the 50th anniversary, and every fifth anniversary after that. 

In the United States, a couple can receive a greeting from the President for any wedding anniversary on or after the 50th. 

Roman Catholics may apply to the Office of Papal Charities for a Papal blessing for wedding anniversaries of a special nature (25th, 50th, 60th, etc.).  

Celebration and gifts

The names of some anniversaries provide guidance for appropriate or traditional gifts for the spouses to give each other; if there is a party these can be brought by the guests or influence the theme or decoration. These gifts vary in different countries, but some years have well-established connections now common to most nations: 5th Wooden, 10th Tin, 15th Crystal, 20th China, 25th Silver, 30th Pearl, 40th Ruby, 50th Gold, 60th Diamond, 70th Platinum. In English speaking countries the first, wooden, gift was cut on the day of celebration and then presented to the wife as a finished article before the next two quarter days had passed. The tradition may have originated in medieval Germany where, if a married couple lived to celebrate the 25th anniversary of their wedding, the wife was presented by her friends and neighbours with a silver wreath to congratulate them for the good fortune that had prolonged the lives of the couple. Over time the number of symbols expanded and the German tradition came to assign gifts that had direct connections with each stage of married life. The symbols have changed over time. For example, in the United Kingdom, diamond was a well known symbol for the 75th anniversary, but this changed to the now more common 60th anniversary after Diamond Anniversary of Queen Victoria. The current monarch Queen Elizabeth II's 60th year on the throne was widely marked as her Diamond Jubilee and commemorated in 2012.

Anniversary Gift Lists 

Lists of wedding anniversary gifts vary by country. The traditional and modern U.S. versions were compiled by librarians at the Chicago Public Library.    

Flower gifts

Gemstone Jewelry Anniversary gifts

For lovers of jewelry, the Jewelry Anniversary list with gemstone jewelry for each anniversary year was established by The American Gem Society, The Gemological Institute of America, The American Gem Trade Association, Jewelers of America, and the International Colored Gemstone Association.

Passage:
To the Finland Station
To the Finland Station: A Study in the Writing and Acting of History (1940) is a book by American critic and historian Edmund Wilson. The work presents the history of revolutionary thought and the birth of socialism, from the French Revolution through the collaboration of Marx and Engels to the arrival of Lenin at the Finlyandsky Rail Terminal in St. Petersburg in 1917.

Form and Content

Wilson "had the present book in mind for six years,"  which Robert Giroux edited. 

The book is divided into three sections.

The first spends five of eight chapters on Michelet and then discusses the "Decline of Revolutionary Tradition" vis-a-vis Ernest Renan, Hippolyte Taine, and Anatole France.

The second deals with Socialism and Communism in sixteen chapters. The first four chapters discuss the "Origins of Socialism" vis-a-vis Babeuf, Saint-Simon, Fourier and Robert Owen, and Enfantin and "American Socialists" (Margaret Sanger and Horace Greeley). The second group of twelve chapters deal mostly with the development of thought in Karl Marx in light of his influences, partnership with Friedrich Engels and opposition from Lassalle and Bakunin.

The third spends six chapters, dealing two each on Lenin, Trotsky, and again Lenin. Important writings addressed include Lenin's "What Is to Be Done?" and Trotsky's Literature and Revolution, My Life, biography of Lenin, and The History of the Russian Revolution.

The book also mentions Eleanor Marx, Nadezhda Krupskaya, Annie Besant, Charles Bradlaugh and Georgy Gapon.

Publication

Harcourt, Brace & Co. first published this book in September 1940.  Doubleday's Anchor Books imprint published a paperback edition in 1953.  Farrar, Straus and Giroux published a paperback edition in 1972.  The New York Review of Books published a new edition in 2003, with an introduction by Louis Menand. 

Upon publication, TIME said: Because it makes Marxist theory, aims and tactics intelligible to any literate non-Marxist mind, To the Finland Station is an invaluable book. It is an advantage that, like Milton with the character of Satan, Author Wilson is half in love with the human side of the curious specimens he describes.

In Popular Culture

This book is mentioned as the reading matter of a young Bill Clinton in Hillary Clinton's biography 'Living History'.
Question:
The 1940 book To the Finland Station by Edmund Wilson that traces communism refers to the arrival of Lenin at the said railway station in what city?
Answer:
St Petersb.
Passage:
Tokophobia
Tokophobia, or the fear of pregnancy and childbirth, is the suggested name for a form of specific phobia. It is also known as "maleusiophobia" (though this is certainly a variant of "maieusiophobia", from the Greek "maieusis", literally meaning "delivery of a woman in childbirth"  but referring generally to midwifery), "parturiphobia" (from Latin "parturire" meaning "to be pregnant",  and "lockiophobia". 

Psychological disorder

In 2000, an article published in the British Journal of Psychiatry (2000, 176: 83-85 ) described the fear of childbirth as a psychological disorder that has received little attention and may be overlooked. The article introduced the term tokophobia in the medical literature (from the Greek tokos, meaning childbirth and phobos, meaning fear).

Phobia of pregnancy and childbirth, as with any phobia, can manifest through a number of symptoms including nightmares, difficulty in concentrating on work or on family activities, panic attacks and psychosomatic complaints. Often the fear of childbirth motivates a request for an elective caesarean section.  Fear of labor pain is strongly associated with the fear of pain in general; a previous complicated childbirth, or inadequate pain relief, may cause the phobia to develop. A fear of pregnancy itself can result in an avoidance of pregnancy or even, as birth control methods are never 100% effective, an avoidance of sexual intercourse or asking for hysterectomy.

Tokophobia is a distressing psychological disorder which may be overlooked by medical professionals; as well as specific phobia and anxiety disorders, tokophobia may be associated with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.  Recognition of tokophobia and close liaison with obstetricians or other medical specialists can help to reduce its severity and ensure efficient treatment.  

Primary and secondary tokophobia

*Primary tokophobia is the fear and deep-seated dread of childbirth which pre-dates pregnancy and can start in adolescence. This often relates back to their own mother's experience or something they learned in school.
*Secondary tokophobia is due to previous experience of traumatic birth, poor obstetric practice or medical attention, postpartum depression or other such upsetting events.

A few reactions to childbirth include the following:

"The truth is that the very thought of having something almost alien-like growing inside me is disgusting."
"It's not too strong to say that the very thought of childbirth disgusts me in a big way."
"It's much more than an anxiety – I am actually physically repulsed by pregnancy and childbirth."
"I even struggle to be around friends when they are pregnant and can't bear to watch or listen to anything about the process of having a baby."
Question:
What is tocophobia a fear of?
Answer:
In labor
Passage:
Tommy and Tuppence
Tommy and Tuppence are two fictional detectives, recurring characters in the work of Agatha Christie. Their full names are Thomas Beresford and Prudence Beresford (née Cowley).
The first time Tommy and Tuppence appeared in a Christie novel was in The Secret Adversary (1922). They started out their career as accidental blackmailers  (all in search of adventure and money), but the detecting life soon proved more profitable and much more exciting.

Novels

Tommy and Tuppence appear together in four full-length novels and one collection of short stories    The collection of short stories is Partners in Crime, (1929, each story reminiscent of another writer's work); the four novels are The Secret Adversary (1922),  N or M? (1941), By the Pricking of My Thumbs (1968); and Postern of Fate (1973).  Postern of Fate was the last novel Christie ever wrote, although not the last to be published.

Detectives

Tuppence appears as a charismatic, impulsive and intuitive person, while Tommy is less imaginative, and less likely to be diverted from the truth (as their first adversary sums him up "he is not clever, but it is hard to blind his eyes to the facts"). They therefore make a good team. It is in this first book The Secret Adversary that they meet up after the war, and come to realise that, although they have been friends for most of their lives, they have now fallen in love with each other.

Unlike many other recurring detective characters, including the better known Christie detectives, Tommy and Tuppence aged in time with the real world, being in their early twenties in The Secret Adversary and in their seventies in Postern of Fate. In their early appearances, they are portrayed as typical upper middle class "bright young things" of the 1920s,  and the stories and settings have a more pronounced period-specific flavour than the stories featuring the better known Christie characters. As they age, they're revealed to have raised three children – twins Deborah and Derek and an adopted daughter, Betty. Throughout the series they employ a man named Albert, who first appears as a lift boy who helps them in The Secret Adversary; and subsequently, as a now married pub owner, renders vital assistance to the pair in N or M?. In Partners in Crime, Albert becomes their hapless assistant at a private detective agency; by Postern of Fate he's their butler and has now been widowed. In Postern of Fate they also have a small dog named Hannibal.

Adaptations

In 1953 the BBC adapted Partners in Crime as a radio series starring Richard Attenborough and Sheila Sim.

The Tommy and Tuppence characters have been portrayed on television by James Warwick and Francesca Annis, first in the feature-length The Secret Adversary (1982), and then in the 10 episode series Agatha Christie's Partners in Crime (1983).

The novel By the Pricking of My Thumbs was adapted in 2005 by the French director Pascal Thomas with the title Mon petit doigt m'a dit.... The movie casts André Dussolier as Tommy (renamed Bélisaire) and Catherine Frot as Prudence Beresford. The action is transposed to Savoie in France. A second movie, Le crime est notre affaire, came out in 2008. Le crime est notre affaire is named after Partners in Crime and stars the Beresfords, but its story is based on 4.50 From Paddington, which was originally a novel starring Miss Marple. A third film Associés contre le crime is very, very loosely based (to the point of being unrecognisable) on one of the stories in Partners in Crime.

An adaptation of By the Pricking of My Thumbs appeared in 2006 as an episode of the Granada television series Marple even though Christie did not write Marple into the original story. In this version, Tommy and Tuppence were played by Anthony Andrews and Greta Scacchi respectively, but, unlike in the book, Miss Marple and Tuppence play the detective roles while Tommy is away on intelligence (MI6) business.

BBC television began broadcasting two adaptations, comprising six episodes in 2015. Set in the 1950s and titled Partners in Crime, it starred David Walliams as Tommy  and Jessica Raine as Tuppence.
Question:
"Who plays the part of Tommy Beresford in the BBC series ""Partners in Crime"", based on an Agatha Christie novel?"

Passage:
Bulbul
Bulbuls are a family, Pycnonotidae, of medium-sized passerine songbirds. Many forest species are known as greenbuls, brownbuls, leafloves, or bristlebills. The family is distributed across most of Africa and into the Middle East, tropical Asia to Indonesia, and north as far as Japan. A few insular species occur on the tropical islands of the Indian Ocean There are about 130 species in around 24 genera. While some species are found in most habitats, overall African species are predominantly found in rainforest whilst rainforest species are rare in Asia, instead preferring  more open areas.

The word bulbul derives from , meaning nightingale, but in English, bulbul refers to passerine birds of a different family.

Description

Bulbuls are short-necked slender passerines. The tails are long and the wings short and rounded. In almost all species the bill is slightly elongated and slightly hooked at the end. They vary in length from 13 cm for the tiny greenbul to 29 cm in the straw-headed bulbul. Overall the sexes are alike, although the females tend to be slightly smaller. In a few species the differences are so great that they have been described as functionally different species. The soft plumage of some species is colourful with yellow, red or orange vents, cheeks, throat or supercilia, but most are drab, with uniform olive-brown to black plumage. Species with dull coloured eyes often sport contrasting eyerings. Some have very distinct crests. Bulbuls are highly vocal, with the calls of most species being described as nasal or gravelly. One author described the song of the brown-eared bulbul as "the most unattractive noises made by any bird".Fishpool et al. (2005)  

Bulbuls eat a wide range of different foods, ranging from fruit to seeds, nectar, small insects and other arthropods and even small vertebrates. The majority of species are frugivorous and supplement their diet with some insects, whilst there is a significant minority of specialists, particularly in Africa. Open country species in particular are generalists. Bulbuls in the genus Criniger and bristlebills in the genus Bleda will join mixed-species feeding flocks.

The bulbuls are generally monogamous. One unusual exception is the yellow-whiskered greenbul which at least over part of its range appears to be polygamous and engage in a lekking system. Some species also have alloparenting arrangements, where non-breeders, usually the young from earlier clutches, help raise the young of a dominant breeding pair.  Up to five purple-pink eggs are laid in an open tree nests and incubated by the female. Incubation usually lasts between 11–14 days, and chicks fledge after 12–16 days.

Systematics

The traditional layout was to divide the bulbuls into four groups, named Pycnonotus, Phyllastrephus, Criniger, and Chlorocichla groups after characteristic genera (Delacour, 1943). However, more recent analyses demonstrated that this arrangement was probably based on erroneous interpretation of characters:

Comparison of mtDNA cytochrome b sequences found that five species of Phyllastrephus did not belong to the bulbuls, but to an enigmatic group of songbirds from Madagascar instead (Cibois et al., 2001; see below for the species in question), and they are now usually referred to as Malagasy warblers. Similarly, sequence analysis of the nDNA RAG1 and RAG2 genes suggests that the genus Nicator is not a bulbul either (Beresford et al., 2005). That the previous arrangement had failed to take into account biogeography was indicated by the study of Pasquet et al. (2001) who demonstrated the genus Criniger must be divided into an African and an Asian (Alophoixus) lineage. Using analysis of one nDNA and 2 mtDNA sequences, Moyle & Marks (2006) found one largely Asian lineage and one African group of greenbuls and bristlebills; the golden greenbul seemes to be very distinct and form a group of its own. Some taxa are not monophyletic, and more research is necessary to determine relationships within the larger genera.

Relationship to humans

The red-whiskered bulbuls and red-vented bulbuls have been captured for the pet trade in great numbers and, has been widely introduced to tropical and subtropical areas, for example southern Florida, Fiji, Australia and Hawaii. Some species are regarded as crop pests, particularly in orchards.

In general bulbuls and greenbuls are resistant to human pressures on the environment and are tolerant of disturbed habitat. Around 13 species are considered threatened by human activities, mostly specialised forest species threatened by habitat loss.
