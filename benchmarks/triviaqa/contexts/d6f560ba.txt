Passage:
House of Pain
House of Pain was an American hip hop group who released three albums in the 1990s before lead rapper Everlast left to pursue his solo career. The group's name is a reference to the H.G. Wells novel The Island of Dr. Moreau, a reference carried further by the naming of their 2011 tour "He Who Breaks the Law". The group is best known for its 1992 hit single "Jump Around", which reached No. 3 in their native United States, No. 6 in Ireland and No. 8 in the United Kingdom. The group broke up in 1996 but reformed in 2010, after the trio had been members of supergroup La Coka Nostra for several years.

Band history

Rise to fame (1991–1993)

Everlast teamed up with DJ Lethal and high school friend Danny Boy in Los Angeles to form House of Pain.  They attended Taft High School. The group was signed to Tommy Boy Records and their House of Pain debut album (1992) went multi-platinum, spawning the successful DJ Muggs-produced single "Jump Around". This song was also remixed twice by Pete Rock, one version featuring a verse from him and one without. The album also featured Cypress Hill member B-Real on the song "Put Your Head Out" and Funkdoobiest's Son Doobie on 'House and the Rising Son', both members of the musical collective known as Soul Assassins.

Fashioning themselves as rowdy Irish-American hooligans (although Lethal is Latvian American), they toured with various rap and alternative-rock bands after their breakthrough. They participated together with Helmet, along with several other rap acts, on the 1993 rock-rap collaborative Judgment Night film soundtrack.

Same As It Ever Was (1994–1995)

Their follow-up album, 1994's Same as It Ever Was, went gold despite minimal airplay and no major hits. The first single, "On Point," is noted for taking a swipe at another American rapper who claimed Irish heritage, "Marky Mark" (Mark Wahlberg) ("Calvin Klein's no friend of mine/So I don't like Marky"). Like Cypress Hill, who, with House of Pain, were a part of the loosely affiliated Soul Assassins posse, they found urban radio airplay an increasingly closed path, which affected album sales.

Truth Crushed to Earth Shall Rise Again (1996)

House of Pain abruptly broke up in 1996 after the release of their third album, Truth Crushed to Earth Shall Rise Again, which featured guest appearances by rappers Sadat X of Brand Nubian, Guru of Gang Starr, producer/rapper Divine Styler and reggae singjay Cockni O'Dire (credited as the Scheme Team). On the release date of the album, Everlast announced his departure from the group.

Split, solo and current affairs (1997–2009)

From then on, the members continued their separate careers. Danny Boy founded an art company. DJ Lethal became a member of nu metal band Limp Bizkit, who would cover "Jump Around" at live concerts, particularly in Limp Bizkit's early years during the Family Values Tour 1998. Everlast achieved multi-platinum solo fame in 1998 with his album Whitey Ford Sings the Blues. The first single from that album was "What It's Like". In 2000, a feud between Everlast and rapper Eminem coincided with the gold-selling Eat at Whitey's, which included minor hits "Black Jesus" and "Black Coffee", and featured a collaboration with Carlos Santana. After the sale of the Tommy Boy Records' master tapes to Warner Bros. Records, Everlast signed with Island/Def Jam, and released the solo LP White Trash Beautiful in 2004.

Later the same year Rhino Records, a subdivision of Warner Music, released a hit collection, Shamrocks & Shenanigans, with singles from Everlast's early solo days, the House of Pain and his post-group solo efforts. Before the release, Everlast announced on his official message board that he was not endorsing the compilation album.

Founded by Danny Boy in early 2006, La Coka Nostra reunited him, Everlast and DJ Lethal for the first time since House of Pain's split. Other group members include Ill Bill of Non Phixion, and newcomer Slaine.

Reunion tours (2010–2011)

House of Pain reunited at a private event held by UFC president Dana White in Boston on St. Patrick's Day 2009. It was officially announced on August 10, 2010, that House of Pain had reunited and performed their first "official" show in a decade at the second annual Epicenter Music Festival in Fontana, California, on September 25, 2010. Though Lethal is still a member of the group, he did not join them on their 2011 reunion tour due to prior obligations with Limp Bizkit.   In April–May 2011 House of Pain attended the Groovin' the Moo touring festival in Australia, and also performed at Scotland's T in the Park Festival on 9 July 2011, as well as Sonisphere UK Festival on 12 July of the same year.

Daphnis et Chlo� was written to a commission from Serge de Diaghilev which Ravel  received probably in 1909.  The Ballets Russes were enjoying an immense success during their first  Paris season, and Diaghilev was eager to secure new works for the following year from  leading French composers. Ravel started work in June 1909, using a treatment of the ancient  Greek novel by Longus, which had been prepared by the choreographer Mikhail Fokine.  Progress  was fitful however, and it was another three years before the work reached the stage.
Ravel described Daphnis et Chlo� as a "symphonie chor�graphique" - though  Diaghilev complained that it was more "symphonique" than "chor�graphique"  ( Marnat [1986], p.343).  At around 55 minutes, it is Ravel's longest work, and it is scored for a large orchestra  (including 15 types of percussion) with a (wordless) mixed chorus, heard onstage and offstage.  [This last was the cause of a public dispute when Diaghilev staged the work in London  without chorus;  Ravel wrote a scathing letter which was published in The Times and other London papers (June 1914).]
There was from the outset a difference in concept between Fokine, who wanted to capture  the pagan imagery of ancient Greek vases, and Ravel who was inspired by scenes of 18th century  painting ("la Gr�ce de mes r�ves, qui s'apparente assez volontiers �  celle qu'ont imagin�e et d�peinte des artistes fran�ais de la fin du  XVIIIe si�cle." Ravel [1938]). It has been argued  that the eroticism of Longus' original text, and perhaps of Fokine's vision, was alien to  Ravel's temperament and experience, and that the ballet is an unconvincingly chaste  rendering of an exuberant love story  ( Larner [1996], p.128-130).  At the very least, Ravel's portrayal of sexual passion is discreet, and it is for the listener  to judge how far his melodies and their orchestration may still fire the imagination.
Rehearsals for the stage production were stormy, with tensions between Nijinsky (dancing the  role of Daphnis), Diaghilev, and Fokine (who left the company at the end of that season).  The premi�re, on 8 June 1912 at the Th��tre du Ch�telet, came only  ten days after the first performance, on the same stage, of the ballet on "Pr�lude  � l'Apr�s-midi d'un faun", in which Nijinsky's masturbatory finale had caused  a furore. Daphnis et Chlo� received only two performances in that season, and its  initial impact was muted, at least in comparison with Stravinsky's L'Oiseau de feu and Petrouchka, unveiled in the previous two seasons of the Ballets Russes.
Daphnis et Chlo� has perhaps had its greatest success in concerts and recordings, in which  its orchestral virtuosity and organic structure can be most fully explored.  There are also  two orchestral suites drawn with little alteration from the full score:
���� Suite d'orchestre no.1 ("Nocturne", "Interlude", "Danse  guerri�re")
���� Suite d'orchestre no.2 ("Lever du jour", "Pantomime", "Danse  g�n�rale / Bacchanale").

Passage:
Foinavon
Foinavon (1958–1971) was an undistinguished Irish racehorse, until he won the Grand National in 1967 after the rest of the field fell, refused or were hampered or brought down in a mêlée at the 23rd fence. The fence was officially named after Foinavon in 1984.

He was at one point owned by Anne Grosvenor, Duchess of Westminster, whose colours were also carried by Arkle. Both were named after Scottish mountains.

1967 Grand National

Foinavon, ridden by John Buckingham, was a rank outsider at odds of 100/1 to win the 1967 Grand National, and his owner Cyril Watkins had such little belief in his chances that he was not even at the course.

For the first circuit and a half, Foinavon played no real part in the proceedings, in which 28 of the 44 starters had safely survived past the 22nd fence (Becher's Brook). However, the most dramatic moment of the race, and perhaps of Grand National history, came when a loose horse — Popham Down, who had been hampered and unseated his rider at the first fence — veered dramatically to his right at the 23rd fence, slamming into Rutherfords and unseating his jockey Johnny Leech. A pile-up ensued. Rondetto, Norther, Kirtle Lad, Princeful, Leedsy and other horses hit the ground, then began running up and down the fence preventing others from jumping it, and bringing the race effectively to a halt. Some horses even began running in the wrong direction, back the way they had come.

Foinavon had been lagging so far behind that Buckingham had time to steer his mount clear of the chaos and jump on the wide outside, long before any of the others could remount or attempt the fence again. At the next obstacle, the Canal Turn, Buckingham looked back in disbelief at the 30-length lead he held with just six fences remaining. 17 remounted horses gave chase,  and 15/2 favourite Honey End closed the gap to within 20 lengths by the final fence, but Foinavon was able to maintain this lead over the run-in. Red Alligator, who went on to win in 1968, was a distant third. 

The incident is almost always replayed on Grand National day, and it has also gained fame owing to the distinctive commentary of Michael O'Hehir.  After the race, O'Hehir suggested that with obstacles like Becher's Brook and Valentine's Brook, the 23rd might one day be named after Foinavon. In 1984, the Aintree executive officially named the 7th/23rd fence (the smallest on the course at 4 ft 6 in) the Foinavon fence. 

O'Hehir's commentary

Irish commentator Michael O'Hehir was better known as a Gaelic football commentator but often covered racing and was brought in to cover the race at the far end of the course, going to Becher's Brook and coming away from Valentine's. His commentary of the carnage at the 23rd fence ranks among the most famous in the history of BBC televised sport and is often shown when BBC Sport puts together nostalgic montages of great sporting moments. O'Hehir received particular respect from his peers for the speed and unflustered coolness with which he identified Foinavon as the horse emerging from the mêlée. O'Hehir later said in an interview that it was precisely the unfamiliarity of Foinavon's colours that made him so instantly recognisable during the race. O'Hehir visited the weighing room before the race, as is the custom of many National commentators, to familiarise himself more clearly with the colours of the silks but found himself completely stumped when looking at the black with red and yellow braces being worn by John Buckingham. Eventually O'Hehir had to ask Buckingham who his mount was. A confused O'Hehir said that his racecard showed two-tone green quarters for Foinavon, as worn by the rider in the Cheltenham Gold Cup a few weeks earlier, but Buckingham explained that the owner felt green to be unlucky and so had registered new colours for the National. 

Defence

Foinavon defended his title in the 1968 Grand National but was brought down at the 16th fence, the water jump. His jockey that year was Phil Harvey; Buckingham had a broken arm. 

Similar incidents

A similar incident occurred in 2001 when Red Marauder won the race from Smarty after they were left clear following a pile up at the Canal Turn on the first circuit, and after the other remaining horses fell or were brought down by the 20th fence. 

It was also reminiscent of the 1928 Grand National, when Tipperary Tim was the only horse to finish the race without being remounted, also at odds of 100-1.

Passage:
Go ahead, make my day
"Go ahead, make my day" is a catchphrase written by Charles B. Pierce and spoken by the character Harry Callahan from the 1983 film Sudden Impact. In 2005, it was chosen as No. 6 on the American Film Institute list, AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes. 

Origins

The phrase "go ahead, make my day" was written by Charles B. Pierce, an independent filmmaker who is credited with "story by" in the film Sudden Impact. The actual origins of the phrase came from Pierce's father Mack, who used to tell him as a child, "Just let me come home one more day, without you mowing that lawn, son just go ahead.....make my day".

In the beginning of the movie, Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) goes into a diner for a morning cup of coffee where he discovers a robbery in progress. He kills all but one of the robbers in a shootout. However, the surviving robber grabs the fleeing waitress Loretta (Mara Corday), holds his gun to her head, and threatens to shoot. Instead of backing off, Harry points his .44 Magnum revolver into the man's face and dares him to shoot, saying with clenched teeth and in his characteristic rough grumble, "Go ahead, make my day," meaning that if the robber attempts to harm Loretta in any way, Harry would be happy to dispatch the robber. At the end of the film, Harry, again, says "Come on, make my day" just before shooting Mick the rapist, who aims his stolen shotgun at Harry's lover, Jennifer Spencer.

Influence

When speaking out against taxes at the 1985 American Business Conference, President Ronald Reagan, himself a former actor, stated "I have my veto pen drawn and ready for any tax increase that Congress might even think of sending up. And I have only one thing to say to the tax increasers. Go ahead—make my day."  Pierce reacted to this saying that his proudest moment was telling his father, "Tonight the President Ronald Reagan of the United States just quoted you."

The movie Sudden Impact became popular in Kenya in the early 1990s. Kenyan kids pronounced 'make my day' as "Makmende" probably due to influence of the local dialects. Over time, Makmende came to be used by children to refer to those who behaved in a conceited manner. In 2010, Makmende was turned into an Internet sensation all over Kenya's Internet community when Just a Band created a superhero character in the music video of their song "Ha He."   The song [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLQrQ8Qvn9s Action] by Finnish band LOVEX features the line in their song lyrics.

During his speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, Eastwood ended by referencing the line.  In February 2015, The Economist featured the headline "Go ahead, Angela, make my day" in reference to the European debt crisis.

Italy

That phrase, although in its Italian localization "Coraggio... fatti ammazzare", was also chosen as the title for the Italian version of the film, and it has become a catchphrase in Italy as well.

'Go ahead, make my day' is a catchphrase from which 1983 film?

Canoeing
Canoeing is a sport or recreational activity which involves paddling a canoe with a single-bladed paddle. In some parts of Europe canoeing refers to both canoeing and kayaking, with a canoe being called a Canadian canoe.

An ancient mode of transportation, modern canoeing was established in the late 19th century. In 1924, canoeing associations from Austria, Germany, Denmark and Sweden founded the Internationalen Representation for Kanusport, forerunner of the International Canoe Federation. Canoeing became part of the Olympic Games at the 1936 Summer Olympics. 

The main form of competitive sport was sprint canoe. Others include canoe polo, whitewater canoeing, canoe marathon, ICF canoe marathon, and playboating. National canoe associations include the American, Canadian, British, Scottish, and Welsh.

A recreational form of canoeing is canoe camping.

Benefits Supervisor Sleeping
Benefits Supervisor Sleeping is a 1995 oil on canvas painting by Lucian Freud depicting an obese, naked woman lying on a couch. It is a portrait of Sue Tilley, then weighing about 127 kg,  a Job Centre supervisor. Tilley is the author of a biography of the Australian performer Leigh Bowery titled Leigh Bowery, The Life and Times of an Icon. Tilley was introduced to Freud by Bowery, who was already modelling for him. Freud painted a number of large portraits of her around the period 1994–96, and came to call her "Big Sue". He said of her body "It's flesh without muscle and it has developed a different kind of texture through bearing such a weight-bearing thing".  

The painting held the world record for the highest price paid for a painting by a living artist when it was sold by Guy Naggar  for US$33.6 million (£17.2 million)  at Christie's in New York in May 2008 to Roman Abramovich.  This record was broken by the Freud painting Benefits Supervisor Resting, which sold for £35.8million ($56.2million) in 2015. 

The painting was exhibited twice at Flowers Gallery:
1996: Naked – Flowers East at London Fields 
1997: British Figurative Art - Part 1: Painting at Flowers East
Question:
Whose painting, ‘Benefits Supervisor Resting’, sold for £35.8million at auction?

Giant pandas in China set record for longest recorded sex session
Mating session between Xi Mei  and Lu Lu lasted 18 minutes and three seconds    and was welcomed by researchers who have struggled to get pandas to breed in    captivity
By Jonathan Pearlman, Sydney, video source YouTube / iPandaChannel
11:01AM BST 05 Apr 2015
Two giant pandas in China have broken the record for the longest mating session ever recorded, just hours after the male set the record with a different female.
The noisy marathon session between pandas Xi Mei and Lu Lu at the Sichuan Giant Panda Research Center on Friday lasted 18 minutes and three seconds. It followed an earlier eight-minute record-breaking session the previous day between Lu Lu and a female panda named Zhen Zhen.
The sessions, broadcast on China Network Television's iPanda website, came as welcome news because there are only 1,864 pandas in the world, according to a census last year. The creatures are listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, although numbers are believed to have risen in the past forty years.
According to iPanda, the record-breaking encounter only occurred after Xi Mei rejected an initial suitor.
Typically, copulation time between pandas is about 30 seconds to five minutes.
“Xi Mei was first set up with male giant panda Yi Bao, but two pandas failed to mate,” the site said on YouTube. “Later, Xi Mei was placed together with male giant panda Lu Lu. This matchmaking arrangement is quite successful, and the pair Xi Mei and Lu Lu ended up mating naturally.”
Pandas have a short mating season and are poor at reproducing while in captivity , possibly because they lose interest or do not know how to successfully mate. Female pandas are often only in heat for two or three days a year during the spring.
Britain’s only female giant panda Tian Tian was recently artificially inseminated after failing to mate with her intended partner. She has not mated naturally since arriving at Edinburgh Zoo in 2011 and has twice conceived after being inseminated; both pregnancies failed.
Giant pandas in captivity have long attracted attention for their failure to mate, which has prompted some researchers to use video guides to try to encourage copulation. Chinese researchers have had increasing success in recent years, though they were apparently not expecting such lengthy mating sessions.
Question:
In China in 2015 the record for the longest mating session between two giant pandas was broken at?
Answer:
18 time
Passage:
Charon (mythology)
In Greek mythology, Charon  or Kharon ( or; Greek Χάρων) is the ferryman of Hades who carries souls of the newly deceased across the rivers Styx and Acheron that divided the world of the living from the world of the dead. A coin to pay Charon for passage, usually an obolus or danake, was sometimes placed in or on the mouth of a dead person.  Some authors say that those who could not pay the fee, or those whose bodies were left unburied, had to wander the shores for one hundred years. In the catabasis mytheme, heroes – such as Aeneas, Dionysus, Heracles, Hermes, Odysseus, Orpheus, Pirithous, Psyche, Theseus and Sisyphus – journey to the underworld and return, still alive, conveyed by the boat of Charon.

Genealogy

Charon is the son of Nyx and Erebus. 
Nyx and Erebus were brother and sister. 
He was also the brother of Thanatos and Hypnos.

Etymology of name

The name Charon is most often explained as a proper noun from χάρων (charon), a poetic form of χαρωπός (charopós), “of keen gaze”, referring either to fierce, flashing, or feverish eyes, or to eyes of a bluish-gray color. The word may be a euphemism for death.  Flashing eyes may indicate the anger or irascibility of Charon as he is often characterized in literature, but the etymology is not certain. The ancient historian Diodorus Siculus thought that the ferryman and his name had been imported from Egypt. 

Appearance and demeanor

Charon is depicted frequently in the art of ancient Greece. Attic funerary vases of the 5th and 4th centuries BC are often decorated with scenes of the dead boarding Charon’s boat. On the earlier such vases, he looks like a rough, unkempt Athenian seaman dressed in reddish-brown, holding his ferryman's pole in his right hand and using his left hand to receive the deceased. Hermes sometimes stands by in his role as psychopomp. On later vases, Charon is given a more “kindly and refined” demeanor. 

In the 1st century BC, the Roman poet Virgil describes Charon, manning his rust-colored skiff, in the course of Aeneas’s descent to the underworld (Aeneid, Book 6), after the Cumaean Sibyl has directed the hero to the golden bough that will allow him to return to the world of the living:

There Chairon stands, who rules the dreary coast -
A sordid god: down from his hairy chin
A length of beard descends, uncombed, unclean;
His eyes, like hollow furnaces on fire;
A girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire. 

Other Latin authors also describe Charon, among them Seneca in his tragedy Hercules Furens, where Charon is described in verses 762-777 as an old man clad in foul garb, with haggard cheeks and an unkempt beard, a fierce ferryman who guides his craft with a long pole. When the boatman tells Hercules to halt, the Greek hero uses his strength to gain passage, overpowering Charon with the boatman's own pole. 

In the second century, Lucian employed Charon as a figure in his Dialogues of the Dead, most notably in Parts 4 and 10 (“Hermes and Charon” and “Charon and Hermes”). 

In the 14th century, Dante Alighieri described Charon in his Divine Comedy, drawing from Virgil's depiction in Aeneid 6. Charon is the first named mythological character Dante meets in the underworld, in Canto III of the Inferno. Dante depicts him as having eyes of fire. Elsewhere, Charon appears as a mean-spirited and gaunt old man or as a winged demon wielding a double hammer, although Michelangelo's interpretation, influenced by Dante's depiction in the Inferno, shows him with an oar over his shoulder, ready to beat those who delay (“batte col remo qualunque s'adagia”, Inferno 3, verse 111).  In modern times, he is commonly depicted as a living skeleton in a cowl, much like the Grim Reaper. The French artist, Gustave Dore, depicted Charon in two of his illustrations for Dante's Divine Comedy. The Flemish painter, Joachim Patinir, depicted Charon in his Crossing the River Styx. And the Spanish painter, Jose Benlliure y Gil, portrayed Charon in his La Barca de Caronte.

Underworld geography

Most accounts, including Pausanias (10.28) and later Dante's Inferno (3.78), associate Charon with the swamps of the river Acheron. Ancient Greek literary sources – such as Pindar, Aeschylus, Euripides, Plato, and Callimachus – also place Charon on the Acheron. Roman poets, including Propertius, Ovid, and Statius, name the river as the Styx, perhaps following the geography of Virgil’s underworld in the Aeneid, where Charon is associated with both rivers. 

In astronomy

Charon, the second dwarf planet of the Pluto-Charon system, is named after him. 

"Haros" and modern usage

"Haros" is the modern Greek equivalent of Charon, and usage includes the curse "you will be eaten (i.e., taken) by Haros", or "I was in the teeth of Haros" (i.e., "I was near death/very sick/badly injured"). During the Korean War, the Greek Expeditionary Force defended an outpost called Outpost Harry.  The Greek soldiers referred to it as "Outpost Haros".
Question:
In Greek mythology Charon was said to have ferried the souls of the newly arrived dead across which rivers?
