Tomorrow Is Another Day (1951 film)
Tomorrow Is Another Day is a 1951 crime drama film noir directed by Felix E. Feist, starring Ruth Roman and Steve Cochran.  An ex-convict who thinks he killed a man goes into hiding with a woman whose boyfriend is the supposed murder victim.  The title of the film comes from the last line of Gone with the Wind.

Plot

Convicted of murder at age 13, Bill Clark is freed after 18 years behind bars. He meets a taxi dancer, Catherine Higgins, but when her New York City police detective boyfriend George Conover catches them together, Bill is knocked out. When he awakens, Conover has been shot.

Bill knows the cops will come after him. He doesn't realize Catherine's the one who shot her boyfriend. She volunteers to go with him and they hitch-hike to California, falling in love along the way. They accompany the Dawson family to the lettuce fields of Salinas, where they find honest work and happiness, changing their identities.

A reporter's article about Clark is found by the Dawsons, who need money badly and turn in Bill for a reward. But back in New York, police reveal that before Conover died, he confessed that Catherine shot him in self-defense. She and Bill are cleared to resume their lives.

Reception

Critical response

Film critic Dennis Schwartz seemed disappointed with the film, writing "Gloomy minor film noir with a happy ending. The movie was made for John Garfield, but he died in 1951. A satisfactory Steve Cochran takes the part and gives it his best shot. Competently directed by Felix Feist (The Devil Thumbs a Ride/The Threat/Donovan's Brain), as always, and adequately written by Guy Endore (blacklisted after the movie for his political activism) and Art Cohn. Though watchable, the social conscious film remains forgettable--unable to leave a particularly sympathetic lasting impression of its outsider characters, whose distrust of the authorities leads them to be anti-social types and humorless downers for most of the pic."

Passage:
Air on the G String
Air on the G String is August Wilhelmj's arrangement of the second movement in Johann Sebastian Bach's Orchestral Suite No. 3 in D major, BWV 1068.

The arrangement differs from the original in that the part of the first violins is transposed down so that it can be played entirely on a violin's lowest string, i.e., the G string.  It is played by a single violin (instead of by the first violins as a group), and the rest of the music is reduced to an accompaniment that obfuscates most of the detail of the original.

Bach's original

Bach's third Orchestral Suite in D major, composed in the first half of the 18th century, has an "Air" as second movement, following its French overture opening movement. The suite is composed for three trumpets, timpani, two oboes, strings (two violin parts and a viola part), and basso continuo. In the second movement of the suite however only the strings and the continuo play. This is the only movement of the suite where all other instruments are silent.

The music of the "Air" is written down on four staves, for first violins, second violins, violas, and continuo. The eerie, interweaving melody lines of the high strings contrast with a pronounced rhythmic drive in the bass.

Wilhelmj's arrangement

In the late 19th century violinist August Wilhelmj arranged the second movement of Bach's third Orchestral Suite for violin and an accompaniment of strings, piano or organ (harmonium). On the score he had "auf der G-Saite" (on the G string) printed above the stave for the solo violin, which gave the arrangement its nickname.

In Wilhelmj's version the piece is transposed down from its original key (D major) to C major. Then the part of the first violins is transposed down a further octave and given to a solo violin that can play the entire melody on its lowest string, the G string. The dynamic markings added by Wilhelmj are more in line with a romantic interpretation than with the baroque original.

As a violin can't play very loud in its lowest register, all the other parts of Bach's music were firmly reduced in Wilhelmj's version: the keyboard part is to be played staccato and pianissimo, causing the effects of interweaving melodies and of drive in the bass part to go lost. In the strings accompaniment version the violins and violas play muted (con sordino), and the bass part for cellos and double basses is to be played pizzicato and sempre pianissimo, with the same change in effect compared to Bach's original.

Later, a spurious story was put about that the melody was always intended to be played on the G string alone.  The violin solo part of Wilhelmj's arrangement is sometimes played on the cello. As a result of the popularity of the piece, on the G string remained in the name of various arrangements whether or not a string instrument playing on its G string was involved. Most of these versions have in common that the original melody of the first violins is played in the low register of a solo instrument, accompanied by a reduction of the material of the other parts of Bach's piece, although occasionally versions that stay more in line with Bach's original can go by the same name.

Care and Feeding of Your Sword
The Care and Feeding of Your Sword
 
Part I: Rules to Remember
 
Taking good care of a sword is rather easy.  Just keep the idea in mind that rust is the enemy.  To that end, there are a few simple rules to follow:
 
1) Fingerprints Are Bad
The oils in our skin are acidic and if left on the blade will etch the surface and cause rusting.  If the blade has been handled a quick wipe with a soft cloth and a bit of oil or wax will remove the danger of the dreaded finger print.
 
2) Moisture Equals Rust
Even the smallest amount of moisture in the air is enough to cause rust to form on the blade.  To prevent this, oil or wax should be applied to the blade and any fittings, and renewed once every six months – and every time the blade has been handled.
 
3) If You Can Not See It, You Will Not Know About It
Storing your sword in its scabbard is fine as long as the scabbard is sealed and well made.   The only downside of this, is you may not notice that fingerprint you left while sheathing the sword; if, however, you store the sword out of its scabbard you, most likely, will notice the fingerprint and correct it. 
 
4) Drastic Changes in Temperature and Humidity Can Lead to Problems
This can cause a host of problems.  For instance, if your sword is stored over the fireplace the change in humidity and temperature can shrink the wooden handles or dry and crack leather wraps and scabbards.  For the other extreme, storing a sword in a bathroom can lead to condensation.  This can lead to rust and in extreme cases will cause mildew or rotting of the organic portions of the hilt.
Question:
What is stored in a scabbard?
Answer:
Single-edge swords
Passage:
Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and responsible to the Attorney General for its operations. The FBI Director is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.  

The current Director of the FBI is James Comey, who assumed office on September 4, 2013.

Responsibilities

Along with the Deputy Director, the Director ensures cases and operations are handled correctly. The Director also is in charge of staffing the leadership in any one of the FBI field offices with qualified agents. The Director briefed the president on any issues that arose from within the FBI until the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 was enacted in response to the September 11 attacks.  Since then, the director reports to the Director of National Intelligence, who in turn reports to the President.[https://fas.org/irp/crs/RL32336.html#n_30_ FBI Intelligence Reform Since September 11, 2001: Issues and Options for Congress]

Lists of officeholders

Bureau of Investigation chiefs and directors (1908 to 1935) 

When the Bureau of Investigation (BOI) was established in 1908, its head was called the Chief of the Bureau of Investigation.  It was changed to the Director of the Bureau of Investigation since the term of William J. Flynn (1919–1921), and to its current name when the BOI was renamed FBI in 1935.

Federal Bureau of Investigation directors (1935 to present) 

The FBI Director is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.  J. Edgar Hoover, appointed by Calvin Coolidge to the predecessor office of Director of the Bureau of Investigation in 1924, was by far the longest-serving director; he held the position from its establishment under the current title in 1935 until his death in 1972. In response to Hoover's lengthy tenure, Congress imposed a term limit of ten years for future directors, which was waived by the Senate for Robert Mueller on July 27, 2011 due to serious security concerns at that time.  In theory, they serve ten-year terms unless they resign, die, or are removed, but in reality, since J. Edgar Hoover, none have served a full ten years, except Robert Mueller, who served twelve years.

Passage:
Delphinium
Delphinium is a genus of about 300 species of perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, native throughout the Northern Hemisphere and also on the high mountains of tropical Africa. 

All members of the Delphinium genus are toxic to humans and livestock.Sierra Nevada Wildflowers, Karen Wiese, 2013, p. 52 The common name "larkspur" is shared between perennial Delphinium species and annual species of the genus Consolida.  Molecular data show that Consolida, as well as another segregate genus, Aconitella, are both embedded in Delphinium.  The name "delphinium" derives from the Latin for "dolphin", referring to the shape of the nectary.

Description

The leaves are deeply lobed with three to seven toothed, pointed lobes in a palmate shape. The main flowering stem is erect, and varies greatly in size between the species, from 10 centimetres in some alpine species, up to 2 m tall in the larger meadowland species.

In June and July (Northern Hemisphere), the plant is topped with a raceme of many flowers, varying in color from purple and blue, to red, yellow, or white. In most species each flower consists of five petal-like sepals which grow together to form a hollow pocket with a spur at the end, which gives the plant its name, usually more or less dark blue. Within the sepals are four true petals, small, inconspicuous, and commonly colored similarly to the sepals. The eponymous long spur of the upper sepal encloses the nectar-containing spurs of the two upper petals.

The seeds are small and often shiny black. The plants flower from late spring to late summer, and are pollinated by butterflies and bumble bees. Despite the toxicity, Delphinium species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the dot moth and small angle shades.

Taxonomy 

Delineation of Delphinium 

Genetic analysis suggests that Delphinium sensu lato, as it was delineated before the 21st century, is polyphyletic. Nested within Delphinium s.l. are Aconitella, Consolida, and Aconitum. To make Delphinium monophyletic, several interventions were made. The new genus Staphisagria was erected containing Delphinium staphisagria, D. requini, and D. pictum, representing the sister group to all other Delphinieae. Further genetic analysis has shown that the two large subgenera Aconitum (Aconitum) and Aconitum (Lycoctonum) are the sister group to Aconitum gymnandrum, Delphinium (Delphinium), Delphinium (Delphinastrum), Consolida and Aconitella. To make Aconitum monophyletic, A. gymnandrum has now been reassigned to a new monotypic genus, Gymnaconitum. Finally, Consolida and Aconitella are synonymized with Delphinium.

Subgenera 

D. arthriscifolium is sister to all other species of Delphinium sensu stricto (so excluding Staphisagria). It should be placed in its own subgenus, but no proposal naming this subgenus has been made yet. The subgenera Delphinium (Delphinium) and Delphinium (Delphinastrum) are sister to the group consisting of the species of Consolida and Aconitella, which together make up the subgenus Delphinium (Consolida). Aconitella cannot be retained as a subgenus because A. barbata does not cluster with the remaining species previously assigned to that genus, without creating five further subgenera.

Species 

Selected species include:

* Delphinium arthriscifolium
* Delphinium brunonianum
* Delphinium cardinale
* Delphinium cheilanthum
* Delphinium consolida
* Delphinium elatum
* Delphinium formosum
* Delphinium grandiflorum
* Delphinium nuttallianum

Reassigned species 

Several species of Delphinium have been reassigned:
* D. pictum = Staphisagria picta
* D. requienii = Staphisagria requienii
* D. staphisagria = Staphisagria staphisagria

Ecology

Delphiniums can attract butterflies and other pollinators. 

Cultivation

Various delphiniums  are cultivated as ornamental plants, for traditional and native plant gardens. The numerous hybrids and cultivars are primarily used as garden plants, providing height at the back of the summer border, in association with roses, lilies, and geraniums.

Most delphinium hybrids and cultivars are derived from D. elatum. Hybridisation was developed in the 19th-century, led by Victor Lemoine in France.  Other hybrid crosses have included D. bruninianum, D. cardinale, D. cheilanthum, and D. formosum. 

Numerous cultivars have been selected as garden plants, and for cut flowers and floristry. They are available in shades of white, pink, purple, and blue. The blooming plant is also used in displays and specialist competitions at flower and garden shows, such as the Chelsea Flower Show. 

The 'Pacific Giant' hybrids are a group with individual single-color cultivar names, developed by Reinelt in the United States. They typically grow to 4 - tall on long stems, by 2 - wide. They reportedly can tolerate deer. Millennium delphinium hybrids, bred by Dowdeswell's in New Zealand, are reportedly better in warmer climates than the Pacific hybrids.   Flower colors in shades of red, orange, and pink have been hybridized from D. cardinale by Americans Reinelt and Samuelson.

The following delphinium cultivars have received the Award of Garden Merit from the British Royal Horticultural Society:

Toxicity

All parts of these plants are considered toxic to humans, especially the younger parts,Sierra Nevada Wildflowers, Karen Wiese, 2013, p. 52 causing severe digestive discomfort if ingested, and skin irritation.J. D. Olsen, G. D. Manners and S. W. Pelletier (1990) Collectanea Bot. (Barcelona) 19 141-151.Sierra Nevada Wildflowers, Karen Wiese, 2013, p. 52 Larkspur, especially tall larkspur, is a significant cause of cattle poisoning on rangelands in the western United States.  Larkspur is more common in high-elevation areas, and many ranchers delay moving cattle onto such ranges until late summer when the toxicity of the plants is reduced. 
Death is through cardiotoxic and neuromuscular blocking effects, and can occur within a few hours of ingestion.  All parts of the plant contain various diterpenoid alkaloids, typified by methyllycaconitine, so are very poisonous.

Uses

The juice of the flowers, particularly D. consolida, mixed with alum, gives a blue ink.Figuier, L. (1867). The Vegetable World, Being a History of Plants. Harvard University. pg 396.

It was launched on December 16, the same day as the Afrikaners defeated the Zulus at the Battle of the Blood River 100 years earlier, not long after the massacre in Sharpeville of 69 unarmed protesters by the security police.
With no military training himself, and in hiding from the government, Mr Mandela travelled abroad where he was offered financial and practical help by countries including Ethiopia and Algeria.
Mr Mandela was adamant that MK, as the armed unit was called, would not kill people but its tactics would be aimed at sabotage. In his own words, the aim was to "hit back by all means within our power in defence of our people, our future and our freedom".
On his return to South Africa, Mr Mandela and his colleagues set up regional command units and set about training their army in bomb making and clandestine operations.
MK carried out numerous bombings during the next 20 years and the pledge not to kill became redundant – in the whole campaign, at least 63 people died and 483 people were injured.

Passage:
Incisor
Incisors (from Latin incidere, "to cut") are the front teeth present in most heterodont mammals. They are located in the premaxilla above and on the mandible below. Humans have a total of eight (two on each side, top and bottom). Opossums have 18, whereas armadillos have none. 

Structure

Adult humans normally have eight incisors, two of each type.  The types of incisor are:
* maxillary central incisor (upper jaw, closest to the center of the lips)
* maxillary lateral incisor (upper jaw, beside the maxillary central incisor)
* mandibular central incisor (lower jaw, closest to the center of the lips)
* mandibular lateral incisor (lower jaw, beside the mandibular central incisor)

Children with a full set of deciduous teeth (primary teeth) also have eight incisors, named the same way as in permanent teeth. Young children may have from zero to eight incisors depending on the stage of their tooth eruption and tooth development. Typically, the mandibular central incisors erupt first, followed by the maxillary central incisors, the mandibular lateral incisors and finally the maxillary laterals. The rest of the primary dentition erupts after the incisors.  

Apart from the first molars, the incisors are also the first permanent teeth to erupt, following the same order as the primary teeth, among themselves. 

Other animals

Among other animals, the number varies from species to species. Opossums have 18, whereas armadillos have none. Cats, dogs, foxes, pigs, and horses have twelve. Rodents have four. Rabbits and hares (lagomorphs) were once considered rodents, but are distinguished by having six — one small pair, called "peg teeth", is located directly behind the most anterior pair. Incisors are used to bite off tough foods, such as red meat.

Cattle (cows, bulls, etc.) have none on top but a total of six on the bottom.

Function

In cats, the incisors are small; biting off meat is done with the canines and the carnassials. In elephants, the upper incisors are modified into curved tusks (unlike with Narwhals, where it is a canine that develops into a straight and twisted tusk).  The incisors of rodents grow throughout life and are worn by gnawing. In humans, the incisors serve to cut off pieces of food, as well as grip other food items.

Passage:
Shadoof
A shadoof or shaduf  (an Arabic word, , šādūf) is an irrigation tool. A less common English translation is swape  and it is also called a counterpoise lift,  well pole, well sweep. or simply a sweep in the US.  It uses a bucket attached to a lever with a fulcrum fixed in the ground. The shadoof was an early tool used by Mesopotamian and Nile River peoples to draw water.  It is still used in many areas of Africa and Asia and very common in rural areas of India such as in the Bhojpuri belt of the Ganges plain where it is named "dhenki". They remain common in Hungary's Great Plain, where they are known as "gémeskút" (literally, "heron wells") and are considered a symbol of the region.  It was also known by the Ancient Greek name kēlōn () or kēlōneion ()

Construction

The shadoof consists of an upright frame on which is suspended a long pole or branch, at a distance of about one-fifth of its length from one end. At the long end of this pole hangs a bucket, skin bag, or bitumen-coated reed basket. The bucket can be made in many different styles, sometimes having an uneven base or a part at the top of the skin that can be untied. This allows the water to be immediately distributed rather than manually emptied. The short end carries a weight (clay, stone, or similar) which serves as the counterpoise of a lever.  When correctly balanced, the counterweight will support a half-filled bucket, so some effort is used to pull an empty bucket down to the water, but only the same effort is needed to lift a full bucket.

With an almost effortless swinging and lifting motion, the waterproof vessel is used to scoop up and carry water from one body of water (typically, a river or pond) to another. At the end of each movement, the water is emptied out into runnels that convey the water along irrigation ditches in the required direction.

Globi
Globi is a Swiss cartoon character often referred to as Switzerland's Mickey Mouse.  He is pictured as an anthropomorphic blue parrot with a yellow beak wearing a black beret and a pair of red and black checked trousers.  He was created by the Swiss cartoonist Robert Lips, as an advertising character for the Swiss department store Globus in 1932 for the company's 25th anniversary. He was originally planned to be called “Kimbukku”, but later renamed Globi after the local Basel German (Baseldytsch) dialect word for the department store that created him. 

History

He initially appeared in a cartoon strip called “Der Globi”, and later appeared in a cartoon picture-book form called “Globi's World Voyage” in 1935.  By 1944, the character gained so much popularity that Globus created a separate company for it, and in 1948 Globi had sold over one million picture books. He was introduced in other markets such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Brazil, but did not do as well. In the 1970s, he was accused of being sexist, racist, and promoting violence, which was based on the attitudes of the 1940s and 1950s, but these accusations did not hold.

Present

He is one of the most popular characters in Switzerland, with sales of over 9 million books, and in October 2003, a full-length film,  “Globi and the Stolen Shadows” was made which was based on him. It was directed by Robi Engler in Anime-style. Beside the books, there is a lot of Globi merchandise, including cuddly toys, crockery, cutlery, clocks, school equipment, card games, food. From December 2008, the Swiss town of Engelberg hosts a Globi theme park.
