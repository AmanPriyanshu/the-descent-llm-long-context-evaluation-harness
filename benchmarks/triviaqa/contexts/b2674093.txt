Passage:
Lathyrus
Lathyrus  is a genus of flowering plant species known as sweet peas and vetchlings.  Lathyrus is in the legume family, Fabaceae, and contains approximately 160 species.  They are native to temperate areas, with a breakdown of 52 species in Europe, 30 species in North America, 78 in Asia, 24 in tropical East Africa, and 24 in temperate South America.  There are annual and perennial species which may be climbing or bushy.  This genus has numerous sections, including Orobus, which was once a separate genus. 

Uses

Many species are cultivated as garden plants. The genus includes the garden sweet pea (Lathyrus odoratus) and the perennial everlasting pea (Lathyrus latifolius). Flowers on these cultivated species may be rose, red, maroon, pink, white, yellow, purple or blue, and some are bicolored. They are also grown for their fragrance. Cultivated species are susceptible to fungal infections including downy and powdery mildew.

Other species are grown for food, including the Indian pea (L. sativus) and the red pea (L. cicera), and less commonly Cyprus-vetch (L. ochrus) and Spanish vetchling (L. clymenum). The tuberous pea (L. tuberosus) is grown as a root vegetable for its starchy edible tuber. The seeds of some Lathyrus species contain the toxic amino acid oxalyldiaminopropionic acid and if eaten in large quantities can cause lathyrism, a serious disease.

Geography
Ecuador, about equal in area to Nevada, is in     the northwest part of South America fronting on the Pacific. To the north     is Colombia and to the east and south is Peru. Two high and parallel     ranges of the Andes, traversing the country from north to south, are     topped by tall volcanic peaks. The highest is Chimborazo at 20,577 ft     (6,272 m). The Galápagos Islands (or Colón Archipelago: 3,029 sq mi; 7,845     sq km), in the Pacific Ocean about 600 mi (966 km) west of the South     American mainland, became part of Ecuador in 1832.
Government
Republic.
History
The tribes in the northern highlands of Ecuador     formed the Kingdom of Quito around 1000. It was absorbed, by conquest and     marriage, into the Inca Empire. Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro     conquered the land in 1532, and throughout the 17th century a Spanish     colony thrived by exploitation of the Indians. The first revolt against     Spain occurred in 1809. In 1819, Ecuador joined Venezuela, Colombia, and     Panama in a confederacy known as Greater Colombia.
When Greater Colombia collapsed in 1830, Ecuador     became independent. Revolts and dictatorships followed; it had 48     presidents during the first 131 years of the republic. Conservatives ruled     until the revolution of 1895 ushered in nearly a half century of Radical     Liberal rule, during which the church was disestablished and freedom of     worship, speech, and press was introduced. Although it was under military     rule in the 1970s, the country did not experience the violence and     repression characteristic of other Latin American military regimes. Its     last 30 years of democracy, however, have been largely ineffectual because     of a weak executive branch and a strong, fractious Congress.
Peru invaded Ecuador in 1941 and seized a large     tract of Ecuadoran territory in the disputed Amazon region. In 1981 and     1995 war broke out again. In May 1999, Ecuador and Peru signed a treaty     ending the nearly 60-year border dispute.

Passage:
Goose
Geese are waterfowl belonging to the tribe Anserini of the family Anatidae. This tribe comprises the genera Anser (the grey geese), Branta (the black geese) and Chen (the white geese). A number of other birds, mostly related to the shelducks, have "goose" as part of their names. More distantly related members of the family Anatidae are swans, most of which are larger than true geese, and ducks, which are smaller.

Etymology 

The word "goose" is a direct descendent of Proto-Indo-European root, *ghans-. In Germanic languages, the root gave Old English gōs with the plural gēs and gandres (becoming Modern English goose, geese, gander, and gosling, respectively), Frisian goes, gies and guoske, New High German Gans, Gänse, and Ganter, and Old Norse gās. This term also gave Lithuanian žąsìs, Irish gé (goose, from Old Irish géiss), Latin anser, Greek χήν/khēn, Dutch gans, Albanian gatë (heron), Sanskrit hamsa and hamsi, Finnish hanhi, Avestan zāō, Polish gęś, Ukrainian гуска and гусак, Russian гусыня and гусь, Czech husa, and Persian ghāz. 

The term goose applies to the female in particular, while gander applies to the male in particular. Young birds before fledging are called goslings. The collective noun for a group of geese on the ground is a gaggle; when in flight, they are called a skein, a team, or a wedge; when flying close together, they are called a plump. 

True geese 

The three living genera of true geese are: Anser, grey geese, including the greylag goose, and domestic geese; Chen, white geese (often included in Anser); and Branta, black geese, such as the Canada goose.

Two genera of "geese" are only tentatively placed in the Anserinae; they may belong to the shelducks or form a subfamily on their own: Cereopsis, the Cape Barren goose, and Cnemiornis, the prehistoric New Zealand goose. Either these or, more probably, the goose-like Coscoroba swan is the closest living relative of the true geese.

Fossils of true geese are hard to assign to genus; all that can be said is that their fossil record, particularly in North America, is dense and comprehensively documents many different species of true geese that have been around since about 10 million years ago in the Miocene. The aptly named Anser atavus (meaning "progenitor goose") from some 12 million years ago had even more plesiomorphies in common with swans. In addition, some goose-like birds are known from subfossil remains found on the Hawaiian Islands.

Geese are monogamous, living in permanent pairs throughout the year; however, unlike most other permanently monogamous animals, they are territorial only during the short nesting season. Paired geese are more dominant and feed more, two factors that result in more young.

Other birds called "geese" 

A number of mainly Southern Hemisphere birds are called "geese", most of which belong to the shelduck subfamily Tadorninae. These are:
* Orinoco goose, Neochen jubata
* Egyptian goose, Alopochen aegyptiacus
* The South American sheldgeese, genus Chloephaga
* The prehistoric Madagascar sheldgoose, Centrornis majori

The spur-winged goose, Plectropterus gambensis, is most closely related to the shelducks, but distinct enough to warrant its own subfamily, the Plectropterinae.

The blue-winged goose, Cyanochen cyanopterus, and the Cape Barren goose, Cereopsis novaehollandiae, have disputed affinities. They belong to separate ancient lineages that may ally either to the Tadorninae, Anserinae, or closer to the dabbling ducks (Anatinae).

The three species of small waterfowl in the genus Nettapus are named "pygmy geese". They seem to represent another ancient lineage, with possible affinities to the Cape Barren goose or the spur-winged goose.

A genus of prehistorically extinct seaducks, Chendytes, is sometimes called "diving-geese" due to their large size.

The unusual magpie goose is in a family of its own, the Anseranatidae.

The northern gannet, a seabird, is also known as the "Solan goose", although it is a bird unrelated to the true geese, or any other Anseriformes for that matter.

In popular culture 
 

There are a number of well-known sayings regarding geese.

"What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander" means what's appropriate treatment for one person is equally appropriate for someone else.

Saying that someone's "goose is cooked" means that they have suffered, or are about to suffer, a terrible setback or misfortune." 

"Killing the goose that lays the golden eggs," derived from an old fable, is a saying referring to any greed-motivated, unprofitable action that destroys or otherwise renders a favorable situation useless.

"A wild goose chase" that one goes on or sends someone else on is a useless, futile waste of time and effort.

Passage:
Bubbles (painting)
Bubbles, originally titled A Child's World, is a painting by Sir John Everett Millais that became famous when it was used over many generations in advertisements for Pears soap. During Millais's lifetime it led to widespread debate about the relationship between art and advertising.

Painting

The painting was one of many child pictures for which Millais had become well known in his later years. It was modelled by his five-year-old grandson William Milbourne James and was based on 17th-century Dutch precursors in the tradition of vanitas imagery, which commented upon the transience of life. These sometimes depicted young boys blowing bubbles, typically set against skulls and other signs of death. 

The painting portrays a young golden-haired boy looking up at a bubble, symbolising the beauty and fragility of life. On one side of him is a young plant growing in a pot, emblematic of life, and on the other is a fallen broken pot, emblematic of death. He is spot-lit against a gloomy background.

The painting was first exhibited in 1886 under the title A Child's World at the Grosvenor Gallery in London.

Reproductions

The painting was acquired by Sir William Ingram of The Illustrated London News, who wished to reproduce it in his newspaper. When it was reproduced and presented in the weekly newspaper as a colour plate, it was seen by Thomas J. Barratt, managing director of A & F Pears. Barratt purchased the original painting from Ingram for £2,200 which gave him exclusive copyright on the picture. Millais' permission was sought in order to alter the picture by the addition of a bar of Pears Soap, so that it could be used for the purposes of advertising. At the time Millais was one of the most popular artists in Britain and he was initially apprehensive at the prospect of his work and his grandson being the subject of commercial exploitation. However, when he was shown the proofs of the proposed advertisements he grew to appreciate the idea, which portrayed the soap as if the child had used it to make the bubbles. 

Later developments

Following the success of this advertisement Millais was attacked in print by the novelist Marie Corelli who accused him in her novel The Sorrows of Satan of prostituting his talent to sell soap. Millais wrote to her pointing out that he had sold the copyright of the painting and so was unable to stop the company from altering it in reproduction. Millais's son later claimed that he had tried to stop the advertisement being made, but had been advised that he had no legal power to do so. Corelli retracted her comments in a later edition of the book.

The advertisement became so well known that William Milbourne James, who later rose to the rank of Admiral in the Royal Navy, was known as "Bubbles" for the rest of his life.

Since A & F Pears was acquired by Lever Brothers, the painting has been in their ownership. It was lent to the Royal Academy, but was transferred to the Lady Lever Art Gallery in Port Sunlight in 2006.
Question:
"Who painted ""Bubbles"" in I 886, the picture used to advertise Pears soap?"

George Clarke (architect)
George Clarke (born 27 May 1974) is a British architect, television presenter, lecturer and writer, best known for his work on the Channel 4 programmes The Home Show, The Restoration Man and George Clarke's Amazing Spaces. 

Early life

Clarke was born in Sunderland and brought up in nearby Washington. His mother, Anne, worked at Oxclose Comprehensive School, where Clarke was a pupil. His father, a printer died when George was 6, and his mother later remarried. By his own admission, Clarke was a popular but very shy child. 

Both Clarke's grandfathers were builders and, after spending school holidays in and around building sites, he decided he wanted to be an architect from the age of 12:

There was nothing else I ever wanted to do. When most of the kids were playing with building blocks and pieces of Lego, I was actually on building sites.

Clarke left school at 16 and found a job with a local firm of architects, David W. Johnson.  He studied for a BTEC in Building and Construction at Wearside College, Sunderland, before gaining a First Class BA Honours in Architectural Studies and a Certificate in Architectural Practice from Newcastle University, followed by a post-graduate diploma from London's Bartlett School of Architecture.  Whilst he was a student, Clarke supported himself financially by renovating people's homes in his spare time. 

Career

Architecture

After graduating in 1995, Clarke trained and worked with FaulknerBrowns in Newcastle upon Tyne, before joining world famous architect Sir Terry Farrell, working in both London and Hong Kong. In 1998, with partner Bobby Desai, he formed his own company, clarke:desai – clients included Simon Fuller and Jamie Oliver.

In 2011, Clarke left clarke:desai and set up a new company George Clarke + Partners, with 25 staff. At the time Clarke commented:

I’ve had a fantastic time at clarke:desai and I’m proud of all the projects we have completed over the years’, but, as you can imagine, my media work has taken me in a different direction and I now want to start a new company that isn’t just about architecture, but also covers all aspects of the design, build and property development business. 

The firm has mainly been involved in renovation and refurbishment projects but it has also designed new buildings.

Between 2001–2003, Clarke was a visiting lecturer at Newcastle University. He is currently a visiting lecturer at Nottingham University's School for the Built Environment.

Television

Clarke's television career came about by chance. He'd approached a literary agent after being asked to write a book about architecture, not realising the agency also represented television presenters. He was subsequently asked to screen test for a new Channel 5 programme called Build A New Life in the Country, which had been struggling to find a suitably charismatic building professional to front the show.  Clarke was offered the job, and then went on to present two more property shows for Channel 5 before being commissioned to present The Restoration Man for Channel 4.

Since 2004, he has been the main presenter for the following programmes:

Property Dreams (2004), Dream Home Abroad (2005) and Build A New Life in the Country (2005–07), all for Channel 5. The Home Show (2008—), The Restoration Man (2010 —), The Great British Property Scandal (2011), The Great British Property Scandal: Every Empty Counts (2012) and George Clarke's Amazing Spaces (2012—), all for Channel 4 and Old House New Home' (also Channel 4 ').

Books

Clarke is also the author of several successful books, including: Home Bible (Orion), and Build a New Life: by Creating Your New Home.  

Personal life

Clarke lives in Notting Hill, west London and is recently divorced from his wife, Catriona. He has three children: Georgie, Emilio and Iona. Clarke has completely renovated his 1910 house, transforming the interior into a modern, slick home, while restoring the exterior to its original appearance. 

Clarke was on the judging panel of the Affordable Home Ownership Housing Awards in 2007.

In April 2012, Clarke was appointed as an independent adviser to the government to help bring thousands of empty properties back into use for families in need of stable, secure homes. 

Clarke is a patron of the Civic Trust Awards scheme.  He is an ambassador for the housing and homeless charity Shelter, as well as a Building Community ambassador for the Prince's Foundation.  He is also a passionate supporter of Sunderland A.F.C. 

He still has family in Blackfell, Washington,and Sunderland, and visits the area at least two or three times a year.

Honours

In July 2012, Clarke carried the Olympic torch through Camden after his brother-in-law Swiggy Drummond, who was the original candidate for the honour, died from cancer. 

In January 2014, Clarke became the youngest person ever to be awarded honorary membership of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Hon RICS).  In July 2015, Clarke was conferred with an Honorary Doctorate of Arts from Leeds Beckett University for his contribution to the arts.  In September 2015, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Wolverhampton as a Doctor of Technology  and, in December 2015, he received an honorary doctorate from Northumbria University.

Beck's Brewery
Beck's Brewery, also known as Brauerei Beck & Co., is a German brewery in the northern German city of Bremen.  In 2001 Interbrew agreed to buy Brauerei Beck for 1.8 billion euro; at that time it was the fourth largest brewer in Germany.   Since 2008 it has been part of Anheuser-Busch InBev.  US manufacture of Beck's Brew has been based in St. Louis, Missouri since early 2012 but some customers have rebelled against the US market version.[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-10-25/the-plot-to-destroy-americas-beer The Plot to Destroy America's Beer - Businessweek]

The Beck's Art Label Campaign has offered artists the opportunity to provide designs to replace the brand's label. It started in London in 1987 with Gilbert and George. The artists created an art label, because Beck's sponsored their retrospective at the Hayward Gallery. The labels of the 2000 limited edition Beck's bottles were matching their exhibition poster.Gibbons, Joanne: Art & Advertising. London 2005  ISBN 9781850435860.  Other participants of the Art Label Campaign are members of the loose group "Young British Artists" and nominees or winners of the Turner Prize. Damien Hirst for example, designed a label for Beck's in 1995, showing his famous spots.[http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O101120/bottle-of-becks-beer-with-label-hirst-damien/ Bottle of Becks Beer with label designed by Damien Hirst | Hirst, Damien | V&A Search the Collections] In 2000 Tracey Emin created a label, which shows herself, posing in a bathtub.[http://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/nov/09/fiachragibbons1 Tracey Emin gets in bed with Beck's | UK news | The Guardian] Furthermore, Rachel Whiteread designed a label in 1993, presenting her artwork "house", which was also financed by Beck's.  The Art Label Campaign has also been parodied by Matthew Higgs, who is a member of the British art collective "Bank". In the Bank exhibition "The Charge of the Light Brigade" in 1995, he brewed a beer, called "Kunstlerbrau".    In 2012 Beck's started giving young and independent musicians the opportunity to design a label for the Beck's bottle.[http://www.becks.com/artbottles/?trusted=yes Beck'S | Live Beyond Labels] Beck's summer 2009 limited-edition labels were designed by the musical groups Hard-Fi and Ladyhawke (musician).

The Wire actor Idris Elba is to star in a new BBC1 crime drama, Luther, about a detective who is "simmering with anger and rage".
London-born Elba, who played the drug dealer Stringer Bell in the acclaimed Baltimore crime drama, will play the title role of John Luther in the new six-part BBC1 drama.
The series will take the crime genre and turn it on its head, according to the BBC , with viewers knowing the identity of the murderer from the start of each episode in a bid to focus the drama on the "psychic duel between hunter and quarry, who sometimes have more in common than either would like to think".
Elba said: "He's a challenging and exciting character because he's so complex. While he's capable of great kindness and loyalty, sometimes he steps over the edge of madness – simmering with anger and rage."
Elba previously complained in a Guardian interview in May about the lack of roles on British TV for black actors, saying he had to go to Hollywood to get his break. "Unlike here, in the US there are lead roles for black actors … I realised that if I wanted to be all I could be, I would have to go to the US," he said.
The drama is being written by the suspense novelist Neil Cross, who was the lead writer on Spooks for the last two series, and it will be made in-house by the BBC. Filming begins this autumn for transmission next year.
"It's an intense psychological thriller which examines not only human depravity but the complex nature of love … and how it's often this – our finest attribute – that leads us into darkness," said Cross.
Luther was commissioned by Ben Stephenson, the controller of BBC drama commissioning, and Jay Hunt, the controller of BBC1, with Philippa Giles executive producing and Katie Swinden producing.

Passage:
Liverpool Tart
The earliest known mention of a Liverpool Tart is 1897, when it was hand-written into a family cookbook, which was recently included in the village website for Evershot, in Dorset.

Basically a pasty tart, the distinctive taste comes from the mixture of moist sugar (sic) and a boiled lemon, minced. In 2006 this recipe was taken up by Gerry Jones of Liverpool and developed with a view to the tart becoming as widely known and appreciated as the Bakewell and Manchester tarts. In 2008 it was being produced as a regular line by two bakeries in Merseyside, Satterthwaites in Crosby and Dafna's Cheesecake Factory in south Liverpool.  The original recipe called for "½lb moist sugar, 2oz butter, 1 egg, 1 lemon, pastry".

The process read;
" Put the butter and sugar into a moderate oven to melt. When melted, let it cool. Boil your lemon whole very slowly (or it will break) until quite soft. Mince it whole as it is, saving the juice as much as possible and taking out the pips. Mince very fine.

Beat the egg well. Mix all well together. Line a flat open tart dish with good paste, and pour in the mixture to one uniform thickness (about ½ an inch), cross bar over and bake. Serve hot or cold."

Current thinking is that "moist" sugar meant dark muscovado, while the lemon may be shredded (after removal of the pips) instead of "boiling and mincing". Once the basic tart is baked and setting, thought is then given to a decorative finish. The original "cross bar over" is generally agreed to mean a lattice of pastry strips across the top, but the most attractive versions include the shape of Liverpool's  Liver Bird in one form or another. It is possible to buy bespoke pastry cutters which can provide Liver Bird shapes in sugarpaste. While these produce the most attractive tarts, they do add yet another level of sweetness,  and the difficulty of removing each limb from the cutter makes this uneconomical in commercial terms. Another popular method is to acquire a flat Liver Bird shape or template, which can be rested on the surface while biscuit-crumb is dredged over the whole tart, then removal of the template leaves a dark Liver Bird in clear view. This is a much quicker process and adds much less extra sweetness.
Question:
Which fruit is traditionally used in the recipe for Liverpool Tart?
Answer:
Lemon
