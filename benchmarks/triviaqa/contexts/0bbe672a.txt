Passage:
Lincoln Handicap
|}

The Lincoln Handicap is a flat handicap horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged four years or older. It is run over a distance of 1 mile (1,609 metres) at Doncaster in late March or early April.

It is traditionally the feature event on the first Saturday of Britain's turf flat racing season. It usually takes place one or two weeks before the Grand National, and for betting purposes the two races form the Spring Double.

History

An event called the Lincolnshire Handicap was established at Lincoln in 1849. It was run over a distance of 2 miles in August. 

The venue introduced the Lincoln Spring Handicap at a new fixture in March 1853.  The first two runnings were over 1½ miles, and it was shortened to a mile in 1855.  The summer race ended when the meeting was temporarily discontinued in the 1850s. The spring version was renamed the Lincolnshire Handicap in 1860. 

The race continued to be held at Lincoln until 1964.  It was transferred to Doncaster in 1965, following the closure of its former venue. From this point it was known as the Lincoln Handicap. 

The bookmaker William Hill supported the Lincoln Handicap for several years prior to 1997. The company started a new period of sponsorship in 2006 which ran until 2014. Since 2015 the race has been sponsored by the bookmakers Betway.

Emeric Pressburger became the first (and              only) screenwriter to be nominated in three different              screenwriting categories in a single year: Best Original Story (The              Invaders (1942) aka The 49th Parallel (win)), Best Original              Screenplay (One of Our Aircraft is Missing (1942)), and Best              Screenplay - Adapted (also for The Invaders (1942))

The visually compelling, Oscar-winning short film with a minimal               narrative, The Red Balloon (1956), won the Best Original               Screenplay Academy Award even though the screenplay consisted of               extremely sparse dialogue.

Divorce - Italian Style (1962) was the first foreign language film to win a screenplay Oscar. Ugo Pirro was the first foreign language screenwriter to have two nominations              in two categories in the same ceremony: The Garden of the              Finzi-Continis (1971) (Screenplay - Original) and Investigation              of a Citizen Above Suspicion (1970) (Screenplay - Adapted)
