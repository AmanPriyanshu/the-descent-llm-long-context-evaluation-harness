Passage:
The Three Dancers
The Three Dancers (French: Les Trois Danseuses) is a painting by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso, painted in June 1925.  It is an oil on canvas and measures 84.8 in x 56 in (215.3 cm x 142.2 cm).

Description

The painting shows three dancers, the one on the right being barely visible.  A macabre dance takes place, with the dancer on the left having her head bent at a near-impossible angle.  The dancer on the right is usually interpreted as being Ramon Pichot, a friend of Picasso who died during the painting of Three Dancers.  (Some critics believe it could well be Picasso's wife Olga Khokhlova.)  The one on the left is claimed to be Pichot’s wife Germaine Gargallo with the one in the centre being Gargallo’s boyfriend Carlos Casagemas, also Picasso’s friend.  Casagemas shot himself after failing to shoot Gargallo, twenty-five years before Pichot’s death, and the loss of two of his best friends spurred Picasso to paint this chilling depiction of the love triangle.

Background

Picasso painted The Three Dancers in Paris after a trip to Monte Carlo with his wife, ballet dancer Olga Khokhlova. At this time, Picasso was attracted to André Breton's Surrealism movement. In 1926 the painting appeared in Breton's work Le surréalisme et la peinture (Surrealism and Painting). Others link Three Dancers to Picasso's failing marriage to Khokhlova.

Its caption at the Tate Gallery gives some insight into the background of the painting: 

It is owned by the Tate Gallery, London, having been purchased by it in 1965, and is currently on display as part of the Tate Modern's 'Poetry and Dream' exhibition.  The purchase was facilitated by Picasso's friendship with Roland Penrose who was a trustee of the Tate at that time.

Cotopaxi - Highest Active Volcano of the World
Cotopaxi - Highest Active Volcano of the World
Venezuela
Cotopaxi
There are certain things we do that mark us forever. When I was staying in Quito for a few  weeks to better my Spanish I met Jörg from Switzerland, he was in Ecuador to climb mountains.
A few weeks before I had seen a glimpse of Cotopaxi, the fifth highest active volcano of the world, a  sight that had been so impressive that it haunted me for weeks.
From then on I felt an inner urge to climb her. There was just one little detail... I had never climbed  a mountain and didn't know if my body was fit for the task.
Jörg shared a room with me and one day suggested that we should have a go and climb one of the  smaller mountains near Quito. If I could make it on this one then there was a chance that the mountain I  desired for was not an impossible dream. Completely exhausted I arrived back in Quito a few days later,  I'd made it and passed the first test.
The first rush of blood that lifted me off my feet was when Jörg wanted to climb Cotopaxi and asked  if I wanted to join him. I couldn't believe it, the dream was becoming reality. It is one of those moments  that reality fades away and you enter a dreamlike state. We headed out to rent climbing gear, got on the  bus and hopped off at our destination.
I set up my tent to spend the night. Cotopaxi watches over us in the background.
This is where my adventure started... the entrance of Ecuador's Cotopaxi National Park (Parque Nacional de Cotopaxi)  where Cotopaxi, one of the highest active volcanoes in the world, is never out of view. From here we would have to hike for 3 days to get to the highest  refuge cabin at the foot of the mountain. Every day was just wonderful, the scenery so beautiful, green plains, lakes,  wild horses and then... there she was... Cotopaxi, the fifth highest active volcano in the world, reaching 5,897 meters (19,347 feet),  a mountain with such a beauty that it leaves you speechless, the world of senses disappears, the dreamlike state is  reality.
We reached the refuge cabin (4,800m./15,748 ft.) early afternoon. Hiking to this altitude let our bodies  acclimatize easily. That same night it happened. There was full moon and everybody at the refuge  had already left. Jörg gave me some advice, go slowly and steadily but do not stop. We set  out at 2 a.m., the moon lighting the way in a cloudless sky. This altitude demands some efforts  of your body and when we hit the ever staying snow-line it was time to put on our gear.
We went slowly but steadily; passing everybody that had left hours before us. We even passed the  Ecuadorian army, they had be doing some interesting exercises with their new recruits during the  afternoon, and they were not happy. At one stage Jörg had no clue of the route to follow and  we decided to let the army pass and follow in their footsteps.

Our destination, the summit of Cotopaxi
The sun was arising slowly, casting her light on Cotopaxi and warming my body. The summit was  not far away now, my dream was becoming reality by each step I was forcing myself to take. Once  passed 5,500 meters (18,000 feet) my body was giving me some signs of protest, my steps were becoming slower and slower,  exhaustion was getting the overhand, not able to think clearly anymore, just this urge to conquer her  by forcing myself to move on...
I remember the last 100 meters (33 feet), Jörg was pulling at the rope that held us together, urging  me to keep on going, he knew that my body had reached its limits. I can only say that, when I finally stood  on top of the most beautiful mountain I had ever seen, a sense of complete unity with the world that surrounded  me embraced my body and soul.
PS: Finally I can thank Jörg van der Heyden for inviting me to climb Cotopaxi. Without him I would never have  lived this unforgettable experience. It is something that will be cherished forever.

Passage:
Gold medal
A gold medal is the highest medal awarded for highest achievement in a non-military field. Its name derives from the use of at least a fraction of gold in form of plating or alloying in its manufacture. The award concept arose in the military, initially by simple recognition of military rank, and later by decorations for admission to military orders dating back to medieval times.

Since the eighteenth century, gold medals have been awarded in the arts, for example, by the Royal Danish Academy, usually as a symbol of an award to give an outstanding student some financial freedom. Others offer only the prestige of the award. Many organizations now award gold medals either annually or extraordinarily, including UNESCO and various academic societies.

While some gold medals are solid gold, others are gold-plated or silver-gilt, like those of the Olympic Games, the Lorentz Medal, the United States Congressional Gold Medal (displayed to the right) and the Nobel Prize medal. Nobel Prize medals consist of 18 carat green gold plated with 24 carat gold. Before 1980 they were struck in 23 carat gold.

Military origins

Before the establishment of standard military awards, e.g., the Medal of Honor, it was common practice to have a medal specially created to provide national recognition for a significant military or naval victory or accomplishment. In the United States, Congress would enact a resolution asking the President to reward those responsible. The commanding officer would receive a gold medal and his officers silver medals.  Other countries similarly honored their military and naval victors in a similar fashion.

Competition medals

Medals have historically been given as prizes in various types of competitive activities, especially athletics.

Traditionally, medals are made of the following metals:

# Gold (or another yellow metal, e.g., brass)
# Silver (or another grey metal, e.g., steel)
# Bronze

Occasionally, Platinum medals can be awarded.

These metals designate the first three Ages of Man in Greek mythology: the Golden Age, when men lived among the gods, the Silver Age, where youth lasted a hundred years, and the Bronze Age, the era of heroes.

The custom of awarding the sequence of gold, silver, and bronze medals for the first three highest achievers dates from at least the 19th century, with the National Association of Amateur Athletes in the United States awarding such medals as early as 1884. 

This standard was adopted for Olympic competition at the 1904 Summer Olympics. At the 1896 event, silver was awarded to winners and bronze to runners-up, while at 1900 other prizes were given, not medals.

Olympic Games

At the modern Olympic Games, winners of a sporting discipline receive a gold medal in recognition of their achievement.

At the Ancient Olympic Games only one winner per event was crowned with kotinos, an olive wreath made of wild olive leaves from a sacred tree near the temple of Zeus at Olympia. Aristophanes in Plutus makes a remark why victorious athletes are crowned with wreath made of wild olive instead of gold.  
Herodotus describes a story that explains why there were only a few Greek men at the Battle of Thermopylae since "all other men were participating in the Olympic Games" and that the prize for the winner was "an olive-wreath". When Tigranes, an Armenian general learned this, he uttered to his leader: "Good heavens! what kind of men are these against whom you have brought us to fight? Men who do not compete for possessions, but for honour".  Hence medals were not awarded at the ancient Olympic Games.

At the 1896 Summer Olympics, winners received a silver medal and the second-place finisher received a bronze medal. In 1900, most winners received cups or trophies instead of medals. The next three Olympics (1904, 1908, 1912) awarded the winners solid gold medals, but the medals themselves were smaller. The use of gold rapidly declined with the onset of the First World War and also with the onset of the Second World War.  The last series of Olympic medals to be made of solid gold were awarded at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm, Sweden.

Olympic Gold medals are required to be made from at least 92.5% silver, and must contain a minimum of 6 grams of gold. All Olympic medals must be at least 60mm in diameter and 3mm thick. Minting the medals is the responsibility of the Olympic host. From 1928 through 1968 the design was always the same: the obverse showed a generic design by Florentine artist Giuseppe Cassioli of Greek goddess Nike with Rome's Colloseum in the background and text naming the host city; the reverse showed another generic design of Nike saluting an Olympic champion.

From the 1972 Summer Olympics through 2000, Cassioli's design (or a slight modification) remained on the obverse with a custom design by the host city on the reverse. Noting that Cassioli's design showed a Roman amphitheater for what originally were Greek games, a new obverse design was commissioned for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. For the 2008 Beijing Olympics medals had a diameter of 70mm and were 6mm thick, with the front displaying a winged figure of victory and the back showed a Beijing Olympics symbol surrounded by an inset jade circle.

Winter Olympics medals have been of more varied design. The silver and bronze medals have always borne the same designs.

Other gold medal awards

The award of a gold medal, often coupled with the award of silver and bronze medals to the next place finishers, has been adopted in other competitive fields, such as music and writing, as well as some competitive games. Typically bronze medals are awarded only to third place, but in some contests there is some variety, such as International barbershop music contests where bronze medals are awarded for third, fourth, and fifth place.

Passage:
Julia Barfield
Julia Barfield (born 1952) is a British architect and director of Marks Barfield Architects, established in 1989. Barfield created the London Eye together with husband partner David Marks. Barfield has interest in vernacular architecture, geometry and in the way nature "designs and organizes itself so efficiently". She was influenced by Buckminster Fuller and his beliefs on how architects have a social and environmental responsibility. 

Education 

Julia Barfield studied at the Architectural Association School of Architecture from 1972 to 1978. During her year out, she went to South America and worked in the barriadas of Lima in Peru designing housing and a community centre.

Experience 

After graduation, Barfield worked for Foster and Partners for nine years. In 1990, together with husband David Marks, they founded Marks Barfield Architects. During the last 13 years, with Marks, she has designed projects in the leisure, housing, transport, education and cultural sectors. 

London Eye

The best thing about the Eye is the journey. It’s not like the Eiffel tower, where you get in a dark lift and come out on to a platform at the top. The trip round is as important as the view. -Julia Barfield, 2015

In 1993, the Sunday Times and the Architecture Foundation held an open competition to design a landmark for the millennium, which would in turn be the London Eye. 

Awards 

Barfield is the winner of "Architectural Practice of the Year" in 2001 and a "Queen's Award for Enterprise" in 2003.
