Ed Ames - They Call the Wind Maria Lyrics
A way out here, they've got a name
For rain and wind and fire
The rain is Tess, the fire is Joe
And they call the wind Maria
Maria blows the stars around
And sends the clouds a flying
Maria makes the mountain sound
Like folks were up there dying
Maria, Maria
They call the wind Maria
Before I knew Maria's name
I heard her wail and whining
I had a girl and she had me
And the sun was always shining
But then one day I left my girl
I left her far behind me
And now I'm lost, so God damn lost
Not even God can find me
Maria, Maria
They call the wind Maria
Out here they've got a name for rain
For wind and fire only
But when you're lost and all alone
There ain't no world but lonely
And I'm a lost and lonely man
Without a star to guide me
Maria blow my love to me
I need my girl beside me
Maria, Maria
They call the wind Maria
Maria, Maria
Blow my love to me
Maria

Passage:
The Spanish Flag - Flag of Spain | donQuijote
The Spanish Flag - Flag of Spain | donQuijote
Read the Spanish version
The Spanish flag has undergone various changes over its history. The red and yellow flag we know today, often referred to in Spanish as the rojigualda, was originally designed after the flag of the Spanish merchant and war marines during the reign of Carlos III (1785). The first flag to represent all of Spain was the Cross of Burgundy, which was used until 1793 and which continued to be used as an ensign of the Spanish Empire until 1898.
During the period of Spain’s 2nd Republic (1931-39), the national flag bore the colors red, yellow, and purple, in three horizontal bands. Under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, the flag lost the color purple that had appeared on the Republican flag, and incorporated two important symbols: the eagle and the shield of the Catholic monarchy.
In 1977, two years after Franco's death, the eagle was slightly modified, and in 1981 it would disappear completely, leaving the current red/yellow/red with crowned arms.
The new Spanish flag has three horizontal bands of red (top), yellow (double width) and red, with the national coat of arms on the hoist side of the yellow band. The shield includes the royal seal, which is flanked by two crowned pillars (the Pillars of Hercules) bearing the inscription Plus Ultra.
According to Spanish legislation, the height of the coat of arms should measure two fifths of the flag's width (i.e. hoist), and should appear in the middle of the yellow stripe. The flag's usual proportions are a length measuring three halves its width, in which case the distance from the hoist of the shield's vertical axis should be half the flag's width. In other instances (should the flag be either shorter in length or square) the coat of arms should appear in the center.

Sixties pop star Dave Dee dies after three-year battle ...

Sixties pop star Dave Dee dies after three-year battle with cancer
comments
They were probably as well known for having one of the longest band names in the history of pop as they were for their string of hits.
Between 1965 and 1969, Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich spent more weeks in the UK singles charts than the Beatles.
Yesterday, however, the band was mourning its lead singer Dee after he lost his three-year battle with prostate cancer.
Heyday: Dee, left, with Ian Amey (Tich), Michael Wilson (Mick), John Dymond (Beaky) and Trevor Ward-Davies (Dozy)
He had continued playing gigs until as recently as September.
His friend Sean Cooney said last night: 'He didn't let it get him down, he was defying it.'
Dee, 67  -  real name David Harman  -  came from Wiltshire and was a police officer before finding fame with the band.
Although the group never managed to 'break' America like their contemporaries The Beatles, for a time they were one of the biggest bands in the UK, with a musical style that was well-produced, catchy, loud and energetic.
Their hits included Hold Tight, Bend It and their 1968 number one smash The Legend Of Xanadu  -  in which Dee famously cracked a whip.
Just as important as their music was their flamboyant style. Decked out in camp and colourful costumes they designed themselves, they had a direct impact on fashion trends in the Sixties.
Back in his Sixties heyday: Dee with his band (L to R) Beaky, Dozy, Dave Dee and Tich
'We started to make and design all our own clothes,' Dee said a few years ago. 'Every time we did Top Of The Pops, Carnaby Street used to send their spies down to see what we were wearing and within a couple of days you would see our stuff in the window.
'After us, people like Hendrix were all starting to wear that colourful, glam stuff.'
The band's name came from the nicknames of the five members.
Dozy was Trevor Ward-Davies, Beaky was John Dymond, Mick was Michael Wilson, and Tich was Ian Amey. All four are now 64.
The band continued with their long-winded name even when it became clear that something snappier might have helped them find greater success in the lucrative American market.
Dee, however, was never one to make a decision based on purely commercial considerations. 'I went into the music business because it was a love, not for the money,' he once said. 'It was something I always wanted to do.'
Born in 1941, music initially seemed an unlikely choice. Having trained as a policeman, he had dabbled in music part-time for a number of years before one particular incident provided the impetus for his new career.
On April 17, 1960, Dee was a police cadet who was at the scene of the car accident in which U.S. rock star Eddie Cochran died and Gene Vincent was injured.
Question:
What was the previous occupation of the pop singer Dave Dee?
Answer:
Police agent

Ascari Cars
Ascari Cars Ltd. is a British automobile manufacturer that is based in Banbury, England, and founded by Dutch millionaire Klaas Zwart. The company is named after Alberto Ascari (1918–1955) who was the first double Formula One world champion. Ascari also manages a racetrack, Race Resort Ascari.

History 

Ascari Cars was established in Dorset in 1995. Its first limited-edition car, the Ascari Ecosse, was launched in 1998. After the release of the Ecosse, Dutch businessman Klaas Zwart purchased the company.

In 2000 Ascari built a new facility in Banbury in northern Oxfordshire. Ascari's second car, the Ascari KZ1, was developed at Banbury, which also housed Team Ascari's racing assets. The premises are now occupied by Haas F1 Team.

Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument
The Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument is a national monument protecting the Missouri Breaks of central Montana, United States. It is managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Called "The Breaks" by locals, it is a series of badland areas characterized by rock outcroppings, steep bluffs and grassy plains. Created by Proclamation by President William J. Clinton on January 17, 2001, it encompasses , most of which were already managed by the U.S. government. The adjacent Missouri River was designated a Wild and Scenic River in 1976 and forms a western boundary while the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge is to the east. The Breaks country was a model for many of the paintings done by painter Charles M. Russell.

History 

French trappers found the area in the late 18th century peopled by Native American tribes such as the Blackfoot, Northern Cheyenne, Sioux, Assiniboine, Gros Ventre (Atsina), Crow, Plains Cree and Plains Ojibwa. (The Crow name is Xuáhcheesh Annáppiio, "Where the Crow warrior Skunk was killed." )

The Lewis and Clark Expedition passed through the Breaks in 1805 and were the first to document the region through notes and drawings, and their sighting and documentation of bighorn sheep in the Breaks region was the first time this species was recorded in North America by white explorers. Much of the Breaks region has remained as it was when Lewis and Clark's party first saw it. "The confluence of the Judith and Missouri Rivers was the setting for important peace councils in 1846 and 1855. In 1877, the Nez Perce crossed the Missouri and entered the Breaks country in their attempt to escape to Canada. The Cow Island Skirmish occurred in the Breaks and was the last encounter prior to the Nez Perce's surrender to the U.S. Army at the Battle of Bear Paw just north of the monument."[http://www.highbeam.com/library/docfree.asp?DOCID1G1:71712273&ctrlInfo
Round13%3AMode13c%3ADocG%3AResult&ao= Proclamation 7398-Establishment of the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument.(Transcript) - Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents | HighBeam Research]  

Management and conservation

A full management plan is still under development due to various private inholdings and lease agreements between private citizens and the federal government. While conservationists would like to see some of the Breaks monument lands become designated as Wilderness, local ranchers and farmers, under long standing lease agreements with the federal government who graze upwards of 10,000 head of cattle annually within the new monument, are concerned that the monument status may adversely affect their livelihood and the economies of local towns. Under the proposed management plan from the Department of the Interior, although the resources of the monument will be given better protection, "currently permitted livestock grazing, hunting, fishing, and similar activities will generally not be affected, nor will private property (approximately 81,911 acres [331 km2]) and state land (approximately 38,722 acres [157 km2]) within the boundary of the proposed monument, as well as other valid existing rights."  

In 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the Bureau of Land Management's management plan violated historic site laws with their practices.    The National Trust for Historic Preservation cited the site as one of ten historic sites saved in 2013.

The Breaks is home to at least 60 mammal species and hundreds of bird species. Willows and shrubs are found along the Missouri River banks while sagebrush and short grass prairie are dominant elsewhere.

Passage:
Castlebay
Castlebay () is the main village and a community council area on the island of Barra in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. The village is located on the south coast of the island, and overlooks a bay in the Atlantic Ocean dominated by Kisimul Castle, as well as nearby islands such as Vatersay. Castlebay is also within the parish of Barra.  The village is located on the A888, which serves as a circular road around Barra. 

History

Kisimul Castle is located approximately 100 yd away from the ferry terminal in the centre of the bay that Castlebay overlooks. It is the home of Clan MacNeil, but is currently under a thousand-year lease to Historic Scotland from the MacNeil of Barra.

In the 2010 Channel 4 programme Dom Joly and the Black Island, Joly and Tintinologist Michael Farr identify Castlebay and Kisimul as the locations of Kiltoch and the Ben More Castle used as settings in The Adventures of Tintin comic The Black Island, although the scenes of reaching it by boat and exploring it on foot were filmed at Lochranza Castle on the Isle of Arran.

Economy

Castlebay is home to the majority of shops on the island. The main street forms a square with the ferry terminal and the ring road, and features several grocery shops, a bank, post office, and tourist information centre. There is a larger supermarket now to the west of the village, having opened in October 2009.  There are also several hotels in the village.

Community

Church

The Catholic church in Castlebay, 'The Church of Our Lady Star of the Sea', was opened in 1888 on a mound overlooking the town centre. It was designed by an architect from Oban, G. Woulfe Brenan, along with a house further down the slope for the priest to reside in. The northern gable of the Church features a stained glass window depicting the Crucifixion, whereas the southern gables depict Our Lady Star of the Sea.   In recent times, the Church has undergone renovation works that were completed in early 2007. 

Education

The Castlebay Community School (), is located on the western side of Castlebay. It is the only source of secondary education on Barra. Since 2007, the school has had responsibility for the Castlebay preschool (both the English and the Gaelic Medium),  meaning that with its Primary School division it caters for all ages of school children. In September 2007, the school received an HMIE report heavily criticising the relationships amongst the secondary school's staff and management, but complimenting them in the primary school. 

Transport 

The village is home to one of the important transport hubs of the island - the main ferry terminal. Steam ferries were known to be travelling between Castlebay and Oban in the late 1800s, albeit with notorious travelling conditions. In the 1980s, a roll-on-roll-off car ferry terminal was finally built in Castlebay, allowing much larger ferries to arrive on Barra. Between 1989 and 1998, the MV Lord of the Isles travelled daily between Oban, Castlebay and Lochboisdale on the island of South Uist, sometimes stopping on the Isle of Mull. In 1998, the MV Clansman replaced the MV Lord of the Isles on the Oban-Castlebay-Lochboisdale run. From April 2016, the former Stornoway ferry MV Isle of Lewis will take over the Barra service on a new dedicated service, operating seven return sailings a week between Castlebay and Oban, allowing Clansman to operate dedicated services from Oban to Coll, Tiree and Colonsay. Lord of the Isles will commence a new dedicated service between Mallaig & Lochboisdale, ending South Uist's link with Oban.

The island's ringroad, the A888, connects Castlebay to the rest of the island by road.
Question:
Castlebay is the main town on which Scottish island?
Answer:
BARRA
Passage:
Pope Gregory XI
Pope Gregory XI (; c. 1329 – 27 March 1378) was pope from 30 December 1370 to his death in 1378.  He was the seventh and last Avignon pope  and the most recent French pope.

Biography

He was  born Pierre Roger de Beaufort in Maumont in the modern commune of Rosiers-d'Égletons, Limousin, around 1330. The nephew of Pope Clement VI,  he succeeded Pope Urban V at the papal conclave of 1370 and was the seventh and last of the Avignon Popes.

Papacy

During his pontificate, vigorous measures (e.g., burning at the stake, confiscation of property) were taken against proponents of Lollardy, which had found acceptance in Germany, England, and other parts of Europe. Efforts were made to reform corrupt practices in the various monastic orders, such as collecting fees from persons visiting holy sites and the exhibiting of faux relics of saints.

Gregory confirmed a treaty between Sicily and Naples at Villeneuve-lès-Avignon on 20 August 1372, which brought about a permanent settlement between the rival kingdoms, which were both papal fiefs. 

John Wycliffe's 19 reformation articles on church-related items as he wrote in his  On Civil Dominion   and 21 proposed reformation articles of Johannes Klenkoka's  Decadecon   were submitted to Pope Gregory XI in the early part of the 1370s. Gregory formally condemned fourteen articles of Decadecon in 1374
  and nineteen propositions of Wycliffe's  On Civil Dominion  in 1377.

His decision to return to Rome on 17 January 1377 is supposedly attributed in part to the incessant pleas, demands, and threats of Catherine of Siena.  A return had been attempted by Gregory's predecessor, Urban V, but the demands of the Hundred Years' War brought him north of the Alps again, and Avignon was still the seat of the Bishop of Rome. The project of returning again to Rome was delayed by a conflict between the pope and Florence, known as the War of the Eight Saints. The pope put Florence under interdict during 1376. 

Death

Gregory XI did not long survive this trip, dying on 27 March 1378.  He was buried the following day in the church of Santa Maria Nuova.  After his death the College of Cardinals was pressured by a Roman mob that broke into the voting chamber to force an Italian pope into the papacy.  The Italian chosen was Urban VI. Soon after being elected, Urban gained the Cardinals' enmity.  The cardinals withdrew from Rome to Fondi, where they annulled their election of Urban and elected a French pope, Clement VII, before returning to Avignon in 1378.

Subsequently, the Western Schism created by the selection of rival popes forced the people of Europe into a dilemma of papal allegiance. This schism was not resolved fully until the Council of Constance (1414–1418) was called by a group of cardinals. Boldly, the council deposed both current popes and, in 1417, elected Martin V as their successor. The chaos of the Western Schism thus brought about reforming councils and gave them the power over who was elected, replacing (for a time) the College of Cardinals.

Passage:
Bovinae
The biological subfamily Bovinae includes a diverse group of 10 genera of medium to large-sized ungulates, including domestic cattle, bison, African buffalo, the water buffalo, the yak, and the four-horned and spiral-horned antelopes. The evolutionary relationship between the members of the group is still debated, and their classification into loose tribes rather than formal subgroups reflects this uncertainty. General characteristics include cloven hoofs and usually at least one of the sexes of a species having true horns. The largest extant bovine is the gaur.

In most countries, bovids are used for food. Cattle are eaten almost everywhere, but in parts of India and Nepal they are considered sacred by most  Hindus.

Question 853272 : What is the 10th term of the sequence 64, 16, 4,...?
a. 1/2024
Find the type of sequence.  This is a geometric sequence with a common term of 1/4, because each term * 1/4 is the next term.
For any geometric sequence, the nth term =
where a(1) is the first term, n is the term number you're trying to find, and r is the common ratio.
Let's test it with the third term.  The third term =
= 64/16 = 4.  That is the third term.  See, it works!
The tenth term is
= 64/262144 = 1/4096.  The answer is c.
If you didn't remember the formula, write out the terms, dividing each subsequent term by 4 (which is multiplying it by 1/4), until you reach the 10th term.
64, 64/4=16, 16/4=4, 4/4=1, 1/4=1/4, 1/4 / 4 = 1/16, 1/16 / 4 = 1/64, 1/64 / 4 = 1/256, 1/256/4 = 1/1024, 1/1024 / 4 = 1/4096.

Flying Down to Rio
Flying Down to Rio is a 1933 American Pre-Code RKO musical film noted for being the first screen pairing of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, although Dolores del Río and Gene Raymond received top billing and the leading roles.  Among the featured players Franklin Pangborn and Eric Blore are notable.  The songs in the film were written by Vincent Youmans (music) and Gus Kahn and Edward Eliscu (lyrics), with musical direction and additional music by Max Steiner. This is the only film in which screen veteran Rogers was billed above famed Broadway dancer Astaire.

The black-and-white film (later computer-colorized) was directed by Thornton Freeland and produced by Merian C. Cooper and Lou Brock. The screenplay was written by Erwin S. Gelsey, H.W. Hanemann and Cyril Hume, based on a story by Lou Brock and a play by Anne Caldwell. Linwood Dunn did the special effects for the celebrated airplane-wing-dance sequence at the end of the film.

Plot

Composer Roger Bond (Gene Raymond) and his orchestra are appearing in Miami, with vocalist Honey Hales (Rogers). Despite the warnings of accordionist and assistant band leader Fred Ayres (Astaire), Roger is attracted to the beautiful and flirtatious Belinha (Dolores del Río) in the audience, he leaves the bandstand to pursue her.

Doña Elena (Blanche Friderici), Belinha's chaperone, is informed of this, and arranges for Roger and the band to be fired. But Roger pursues Belinha to Brazil, and organises as engagement for the band at the Hotel Atlantico in Rio de Janeiro, unaware that the hotel is owned by Belinha's father (Walter Walker).  Roger persuades Belinha to allow him to fly her there in his private plane, which runs into trouble inflight, forcing a landing on an apparently deserted island. Under the moonlight, she falls into his arms, while admitting to him that she is already engaged.
 
In Rio, Roger informs his good friend Julio (Raul Roulien) that he has fallen in love, but finds out that Belinha is engaged to Julio. During rehearsals for the Hotel's opening (a brief bit of Astaire tap), Fred is told by police that the hotel lacks an entertainment license. When Roger spots a plane overhead, he comes up with the idea of strapping dancing girls to planes, with Fred leading the band and Honey and Julio leading the planes. The show is a great success and the hotel's future guaranteed. Julio gives Belinha up to Roger while Fred and Honey celebrate.

Gandhi’s March to the Sea
September 18, 2013
by Pamela Toler
The American Revolution had the Boston Tea Party; the Indian independence movement had Gandhi’s salt march.
At the beginning of the twentieth century, the British government in India had a heavily taxed monopoly on the production and sale of salt. It was illegal for anyone to make or sell salt. If a peasant who lived near the sea picked up a piece of natural salt, he could be arrested.
In 1930, Gandhi used the issue of the salt tax to turn non-violent protest against British rule into a mass movement. The Indian independence movement had long focused on British laws that concerned middle and upper class Indians, such as discrimination against Indians who applied for government jobs. Gandhi argued that the salt tax was an example of British misrule that affected all Indians.
Gandhi began his campaign against the salt tax on March 2 with a letter to Lord Irwin, the Viceroy of India, announcing his intention of breaking the salt laws. Ten days later he began a 240-mile march to the sea with seventy-eight followers–carefully chosen to represent a cross-section of India.
Crowds gathered along the route to cheer the marchers on. The international press followed them, reporting their progress each day to a watching world. More protestors joined the march each day. By the time Gandhi reached the shore, twenty-five days later, several thousands protestors marched with him.
Gandhi spent the night of April 5th in prayer with his followers. Early the next morning, he waded into the surf, then walked along the beach until he found a place where the evaporating water had left a thick crust of salt. He picked up a lump of natural salt and urged Indians to resist the tax by manufacturing their own salt.
People across India responded to the Mahatma’s call for civil disobedience. Villagers all along India’s coastline went to the beach to make salt. Volunteers from the nationalist movement openly sold illegal salt in the cities and distributed pamphlets telling people how to make salt. Over the course of a month, the police arrested tens of thousands of people for salt-related crimes and protests. True to Gandhi’s principles, his followers did not resist arrest, even when the police beat them with clubs. Gandhi himself was arrested on May 4 and held without trial or sentence until January. News of the Mahatma’s arrest led to more protests–and still more arrests.
With salt protests breaking out all over India, the British government was forced to negotiate with Gandhi. On March 5, 1931, Lord Irwin signed the Gandhi-Irwin pact, ending the salt protest. Indians were now allowed to collect salt for their own use. Gandhi and other political prisoners were released. More important, the British scheduled a conference in London to discuss changes in Britain’s rule of India.
Gandhi’s 240 mile march had brought India one step closer to independence.
Question:
What product did Gandhi march to the sea to obtain?
Answer:
Salt crystal

Clara Petacci
Clara Petacci, known as Claretta Petacci (; 28 February 1912 – 28 April 1945) was the mistress of the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, and was executed with him by partisans.

Relationship with Mussolini

Petacci had a long-standing relationship with Mussolini while he was married to Rachele Mussolini. Mussolini was twenty-eight years Petacci's senior. 

Part of their correspondence is still the subject of a dispute with the National Archives, based on privacy. 

Death

On 27 April 1945, Mussolini and Petacci were captured by partisans while traveling with a convoy of Italian Social Republic members. 

On 28 April, she and Mussolini were taken to Mezzegra and shot.  On the following day, 29 April, Mussolini's and Petacci's bodies were taken to the Piazzale Loreto in Milan and hung upside down in front of a petrol station.  The bodies were photographed as a crowd vented their rage upon them.
