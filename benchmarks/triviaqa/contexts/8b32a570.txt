Weakest Link
Weakest Link is a television game show which first appeared in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on 14 August 2000 and ended on 31 March 2012 when its host Anne Robinson ended her contract. The original British version of the show is still aired around the world on BBC Entertainment.

History

The format was devised by Fintan Coyle and Cathy Dunning, and developed for television by the BBC Entertainment department. It has been licensed across the world, with many countries producing their own series of The Weakest Link. As with the original British version, all of the hosts wear black clothing (or sometimes dark colours with black). Most versions also have disciplinarian female hosts, again similar to the British original—with exceptions being Fausto Silva (Brazil), Julien Courbet (2014 France), Eamon Dunphy (Ireland), Edu Manzano, Allan K. (both Philippines), Shiro Ito (Japan), Pedro Granger (Portugal), Enrico Papi (Italy), Tseng Yang Qing (Taiwan),Baybars Altuntaş (Turkey) and George Gray (United States). Gray (2002-03) and Courbet (2014-2015) are comedians, and those versions were designed to play off comedy.  Recordings of the show commenced from BBC's Elstree facility, but were switched in 2009 to Glasgow and the BBC Pacific Quay studio centre.

Not all the international versions share the title The Weakest Link. The format is distributed by BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm of the BBC. Australia was the first country to adapt the BBC show, and versions have also been produced in Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lebanon,  Macedonia, Malaysia, Mexico, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Udmurtia and the United States.

In Croatia, in May 2010 the quiz reached its 1008th episode, and with the British original, is the only version to have reached as many episodes.

The Weakest Link franchise is the second most popular international franchise, behind only the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? franchise, which also originated in the United Kingdom. 

Format

A group of 9 (or ranging from 5 to 10, varying among versions) contestants work as a team to try and win as much money as possible. If a person answers the question correctly, the next stage in the chain is reached. If a person answers the question wrong, the money is lost and the chain starts again. A player can "bank" before their question to save the money, but the chain must be started again. If there are 9 correct answers in a row without anyone banking, the maximum money amount is added to the jackpot and the round stops. The time allowed for each round decreases as the game goes on. In some versions, if the contestant takes too long to think, the host may give the answer, and it will be considered incorrect. At the end of each round, the contestants must vote for who they thought was the "Weakest Link" in the round that just occurred, and the person with the most votes is eliminated. If the vote comes to a tie, the Strongest Link can decide which of the tied players should leave. The Strongest Link is the person who had the most correct answers or banked the most money. The host, Anne Robinson in the original UK version, says "(name), you are the Weakest Link, goodbye". The contestant is then interviewed outside the game. The person who was the strongest link in the last round goes first. If the strongest link got voted off, the second strongest player starts. In the UK version, the final round has a 90-second triple stake round with no voting but money is still to be earned. After the final round, a head-to-head contest is played, with 5 questions asked to each player in turn. If there is a tie, the game continues to sudden death. The loser goes home with nothing.

Game rule variations

In the second syndicated version of the American version, after the second last round, the last two contestants do not face the clock and the money tree. Instead, the remaining two contestants go straight into the head-to-head round. Similarly, the French version (2014 to 2015) also does not use the clock and money tree for the final round, and in the penultimate round is the three-player triple stake round for €15,000 and lasts 90 seconds.

Strategy for banking money

In a New Scientist blog article, Erica Klarreich argues that there are only two sensible strategies in The Weakest Link (the U.S. edition) when it comes to banking money. Either players should choose to bank after every correct answer, or after six straight correct answers to maximize the pot. The correct strategy to take will depend upon the skill at answering questions of the members of the team. For all but the weakest teams, the optimal strategy is to raise the pot six straight times without banking. But since this happens so seldom on the show, Klarreich argues, the dominant strategy will usually be instead to bank after every question. The common practice of banking after just three questions would only outperform the strategy of banking after every question if a team maintained a success rate of over 67%.

Passage:
Dipsomania
Dipsomania is a historical term describing a medical condition involving an uncontrollable craving for alcohol. In the 19th century, dipsomania was a variety of alcohol-related problems, most of which are known today as alcoholism. Dipsomania is occasionally still used to describe a particular condition of periodic, compulsive bouts of alcohol intake. The idea of dipsomania is important for its historical role in promoting a disease theory of chronic drunkenness. The word comes from Greek dipso ("δίψα"= thirst) and mania. It is still mentioned in the WHO ICD10 as an alternative description for alcohol dependence syndrome, episodic use F10.26

History

The term was coined by the German physician C. W. Hufeland in 1819, when, in a preface to an influential book by German-Russian doctor C. von Brühl-Cramer,  he translated Brühl-Cramer's term "trunksucht" as "dipsomania".[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119222474/abstract?CRETRY1&SRETRY
0 The history of alcoholism: Brühl-Cramer's concepts and observations - KIELHORN - 2006 - Addiction - Wiley Online Library]
   Brühl-Cramer classified dipsomania in terms of continuous, remittent, intermittent, periodic and mixed forms, and in his book he discussed its etiology, pathogenesis, sequelae, and treatment options, all influenced by prevailing ideas about the laws of chemistry and concepts of excitability. 

Due to the influence of Brühl-Cramer's pioneering work, dipsomania became popular in medical circles throughout the 19th century.  Political scientist Mariana Valverde describes dipsomania as "the most medical" of the many terms used to describe habitual drunkenness in the 19th century.  Along with terms such as "inebriety", the idea of dipsomania was used as part of an effort of medical professionals and reformers to change attitudes about habitual drunkenness from being a criminally punishable vice to being a medically treatable disease.  As historian Roy MacLeod wrote about this dipsomania reform movement, it "illuminates certain features of the gradual transformation taking place in national attitudes towards the prevention and cure of social illnesses during the last quarter of the 19th century."

Although dipsomania was used in a variety of somewhat contradictory ways by different individuals, by the late 19th century the term was usually used to describe a periodic or acute condition, in contrast to chronic drunkenness.   In his 1893 book Clinical Lessons on Mental Diseases: The Mental State of Dipsomania, Magnan characterized dipsomania as a crisis lasting from one day to two weeks, and consisting of a rapid and huge ingestion of alcohol or whatever other strong, excitatory liquid was available. Magnan further described dipsomania as solitary alcohol abuse, with loss of all other interests, and these crises recurred at indeterminate intervals, separated by periods when the subject was generally sober.

Over time, the term dipsomania became less common, replaced by newer ideas and terms concerning chronic and acute drunkenness and alcoholism. 

Examples in fiction

* Whip Whitaker, in the 2012 film Flight, is a dipsomaniac airline pilot who flies by instinct, even when drunk.

* Dwight Carson, a talented writer in The Fountainhead, who is turned into a dipsomaniac on the whim of Gail Wynand
* Charlotte Merriam (actress who plays Mrs. Ritchey in the 1931 movie Night Nurse) who exclaims that she is a dipsomaniac several times when confronted by Barbara Stanwyck's character (Lora Hart) with the fact that Ritchey's daughter is dying from malnutrition
* Peter Morgan Sr., (played by actor Charles Coburn) in the 1938 movie Vivacious Lady, talks about his nephew Keith Morgan's (played by James Ellison) dipsomania ways.
* Geoffrey Firmin, protagonist of Malcolm Lowry's Under the Volcano and one of the more recognized dipsomaniacs in fiction
* Richard Gilmore, a character in the TV series Gilmore Girls, refers to a fundraiser speaker as a dipsomaniac in the season one episode "P.S. I Lo..."

Examples in science

* William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin writing to George FitzGerald on April 9, 1896:  I have not had a moment's peace or happiness in respect to electromagnetic theory since Nov. 28, 1846 (see vol i. p. 80 M.P.P). All this time I have been liable to fits of ether dipsomania, kept away at intervals only by rigorous abstention from thought on the subject.

Mention hamsters and most people recall a fond childhood memory, often of an escaped pet that’s found with its cute little cheeks stuffed full of loot.
Mine involves Chipper, my dwarf Russian hamster, which was bitten by my cat and died a few days later—a lesson to my 11-year-old self to be more cautious. ( Read more about hamsters as pets .)
A Syrian or golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) sitting in its subterranean food store of grains and corn.

I hadn’t given hamsters much more thought until recently, when I was asked to research the origins of the popular Syrian hamster—also known as the golden or teddy bear hamster. Only then did I realize these furry pets haven’t always been spinning on wheels in children’s bedrooms.
In fact, there are 26 species of wild hamster that run free in parts of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, including Mesocricetus auratus, the Syrian hamster, which comes from the region surrounding Aleppo, Syria —the city currently under siege amid the Middle Eastern country’s ongoing war. (Related pictures: “Syrian Cultural Sites Damaged by Conflict .”)
The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the burrowing mammal as vulnerable : It has a small range, possibly less than about 1,900 square miles (5,000 square kilometers).
The first mention of the Syrian hamster was in 1797, when physician Alexander Russell came across them in the wild and described the rodents (though didn’t give them a name) in a publication called The Natural History of Aleppo.
It would be another 40 years or so until George Robert Waterhouse, curator of the London Zoological Society, formally named the species the golden hamster, according to Peter Logsdail, a hamster expert and author of Hamster Lopaedia.
Waterhouse described an animal with soft fur and a silk-like gloss, with white feet and a tail and body colors of yellow and lead gray. Its “moustache”—what we’d call whiskers today—was black and white.
That pretty much covers what a modern golden hamster looks like, Logsdail told me, although nowadays there are all kinds of hues, from the chocolate tortoiseshell to the banded cinnamon. That’s why its preferred name these days is Syrian hamster, since a lot of them aren’t golden anymore.
Out of the Wild
So how did the Syrian hamster get to Western Europe and America? We can thank Israel Aharoni, a zoologist who led a 1930 expedition to look for golden hamsters in Aleppo. He enlisted local Sheikh El-Beled to dig up a wheat field, where they found—at a depth of 8 feet (2.4 meters)—a golden hamster and her 11 young.
Aharoni put the family in a box, thinking that the mom would look after them. Instead, “mum did what happens when she’s disturbed—she attacked one of the babies and chewed its head off,” Logsdail said.
So the mother was euthanized, leaving Aharoni to raise ten babies by hand. Not surprising to most kids, the babies gnawed their way out of the wooden box, and Aharoni got nine of them back.
Once they were ensconced at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University, another five made a jailbreak—leaving Aharoni with just four hamsters, which bred very successfully (the Syrian hamster has the shortest gestation period of any hamster, just 16 days). (Also see “ 5 Jerboa Facts: Explaining Cute Jumping Rodent .”)
The offspring were then sent to different universities and institutions, including the London Zoo, in the mid-1930s and into the mid-1940s they had become pets in the U.K. and the U.S. In 1971, another litter of 12 were found in Aleppo and sent to the U.S. The rest, as they say, is hamster history.
Considering Syrian hamsters are already rare in the wild, scientists don’t know if any remain. But I hope they’re still there underground doing what hamsters do best: outwitting us humans.

Football League First Division
The Football League First Division is a former division of the Football League. Between 1888 and 1992 it was the top level division in the English football league system. However following the creation of the FA Premier League it subsequently became a second level division. In 2004 it was rebranded as the Football League Championship.

History

The Football League was founded in 1888 by Aston Villa director William McGregor. It originally consisted of a single division of 12 clubs (Accrington, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Burnley, Derby County, Everton, Notts County, Preston North End, Stoke (now Stoke City), West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers), known as The Football League. When the League admitted additional members from the rival Football Alliance in 1892, it was split into two divisions.

For the next 100 years, the First Division was the top professional league in English football. Then, in 1992 the 22 clubs making up the First Division elected to resign from the Football League and set up the Premier League. The Football League was consequently re-organised, with the Second, Third and Fourth Divisions now renamed the First, Second and Third respectively. Thus, the First Division, while still the top level of the Football League, now became the second level of the entire English football league system.

The First Division was renamed as the Football League Championship prior to the start of the 2004–05 season, as part of a league-wide rebrand.

Liverpool were the most frequent winners of the First Division when it was the top flight of English football, winning it a total of 18 times. 

After the creation of the Premier League, the new Division One title was won more than once by only one club; Sunderland, who won it in 1996 and 1999.

Size

The First Division initially consisted of 12 founder clubs; since then it has undergone a series of expansions as football became more popular and the number of quality teams increased. There were also a series of contractions in the late 1980s, although they were soon reversed, as follows:

† as the second tier of professional football in England from 1992

Player's medals

As of the 1947–48 season making 7 appearances for their club during the season was not enough for a player to qualify for a winners medal.

As of the 1975–76 season players had to make 14 appearances for their club during the season in order to qualify for a winners medal.

'HONEY, I FORGOT TO DUCK,' INJURED REAGAN TELLS WIFE
By LYNN ROSELLINI, Special to the New York Times
Published: March 31, 1981
WASHINGTON, March 30— Shortly before he was wheeled into the operating room, President Reagan looked up at his wife, Nancy, and told her: ''Honey, I forgot to duck.''
Nancy Reagan kissed her husband and then, as he was wheeled into surgery, she turned and went into a nearby room to wait out the long afternoon.
She was pale but appeared calm.  Mrs. Reagan had just returned to the White House from a luncheon when she was told by the Secret Service at 2:35 P.M. that there had been a shooting at the Capital Hilton Hotel. But it was not until she reached George Washington University Hospital a few minutes later that she learned her husband had been shot.
Joins President in Room
As her limousine pulled up to the emergency entrance of the gray, cinderblock hospital on Washington Circle, she jumped out and sprinted through the doorway. Inside, Mrs. Reagan joined the President in his room while doctors prepared him for surgery. When it was time for Mr. Reagan to be wheeled down the hall, his wife held on to the handrail of his bed while doctors and Secret Service men accompanied them.
But when the group reached the automatic doors that lead to a suite of 10 operating rooms, Mrs. Reagan was told that she could not accompany her husband inside. She went for a time to the hospital chapel and also met with the wives of James S. Brady, the President's press secretary, and Tim McCarthy, a Secret Service agent. Both men were also wounded in the attack on the President.
Mrs. Reagan saw her husband after the operation and then went back to the White House.  Sheila Patton, the First Lady's press secretary, said tonight that she was grateful for the outpouring of support and prayers for her husband.
The President's younger son, 23-year-old Ronald Prescott Reagan, a dancer with the Joffrey II ballet, was in Lincoln, Neb., preparing to perform with the troupe this evening at Lincoln's Kimball Recital Hall when he received word of the assassination attempt.
He and his wife, Doria Palmieri, went from their hotel under heavy security to Lincoln Municipal Airport and flew to the capital to join his mother.
Maureen Reagan, 39, and Michael Reagan, 35, President Reagan's daughter and son by the actress Jane Wyman, were in California when they learned of the shooting.  Mr. Reagan said he, his wife and Miss Maureen and another sister, Patti Davis, 28, would fly to Washington so that when their father ''opens his eyes and comes out of sedation, we will be there.''
''This mission,'' he said with tears streaming down his face, ''is really is a mission of love - love for Ronald Reagan'' ''A lot of things have been written about our family and our family's independence. One thing about us, we love Ronald Reagan and we love Nancy Reagan.''
His sister Maureen urged the ''the American people to get angry and propose laws'' to prevent such incidents. ''I've often said perhaps it's not guns we should outlaw, but ammunition,'' she said.  ''But something has to be done.'' Son Is Optimistic
Her brother, speaking to reporters on the lawn of his home in the Sherman Oaks section of Los Angeles, was optimistic about the President's recovery.
''My father is a strong person and is in good shape,'' he said.  ''He'll probably come out here at the end of April, go to my sister's wedding and go to the ranch and cut some wood and put this thing behind him.''
Question:
"Who said ""honey, I forgot to duck"" after being shot in 1981?"

Passage:
Victoria Peak
Victoria Peak (, or previously ) is a mountain in the western half of Hong Kong Island. It is also known as Mount Austin, and locally as The Peak. With an elevation of 552 m, it is the highest mountain on Hong Kong island, ranked 31 in terms of elevation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Tai Mo Shan is the highest point in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region with an elevation of 957 m).

The summit is occupied by a radio telecommunications facility and is closed to the public. However, the surrounding area of public parks and high-value residential land is the area that is normally meant by the name The Peak. It is a major tourist attraction that offers views over Central, Victoria Harbour, Lamma Island and the surrounding islands.

History

As early as the 19th century, the Peak attracted prominent European residents because of its panoramic view over the city and its temperate climate compared to the sub-tropical climate in the rest of Hong Kong. The sixth Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Richard MacDonnell had a summer residence built on the Peak circa 1868. Those that built houses named them whimsically, such as The Eyrie, and the Austin Arms.

These original residents reached their homes by sedan chairs, which were carried up and down the steep slope of Victoria Peak. This limited development of the Peak until the opening of the Peak Tram funicular in 1888.

The boost to accessibility caused by the opening of the Peak Tram created demand for residences on the Peak. Between 1904 and 1930, the Peak Reservation Ordinance designated the Peak as an exclusive residential area reserved for non-Chinese. They also reserved the Peak Tram for the use of such passengers during peak periods. The Peak remains an upmarket residential area, although residency today is based on wealth.

Ecology

The Peak is home to many species of birds, most prominently the black kite, and numerous species of butterflies.

Tourism

With some seven million visitors every year, the Peak is a major tourist attraction of Hong Kong.  It offers spectacular views of the city and its waterfront. The viewing deck also has coin-operated telescopes that the visitors can use to enjoy the cityscape. The number of visitors led to the construction of two major leisure and shopping centres, the Peak Tower and the Peak Galleria, situated adjacent to each other.

The Peak Tower incorporates the upper station of the Peak Tram, the funicular railway that brings passengers up from the St. John's Cathedral in Hong Kong's Central district, whilst the Peak Galleria incorporates the bus station used by the Hong Kong public buses and green minibuses on the Peak. The Peak is also accessible by taxi and private car via the circuitous Peak Road, or by walking up the steep Old Peak Road from near the Zoological Botanical Gardens. The nearest MTR station is Central. 

Victoria Peak Garden is located on the site of Mountain Lodge, the Governor's old summer residence, and is the closest publicly accessible point to the summit. It can be reached from Victoria Gap by walking up Mount Austin Road, a climb of about 150 m. Another popular walk is the level loop along Lugard Road, giving good views of Hong Kong's Central district and Kowloon, and then returning via Harlech Road, encircling the summit at the level of the Peak Tower. 

There are several restaurants on Victoria Peak, most of which are located in the two shopping centres. However, the Peak Lookout Restaurant, is housed in an older and more traditional building which was originally a spacious house for engineers working on the Peak Tramway. It was rebuilt in 1901 as a stop area for sedan chairs, but was re-opened as a restaurant in 1947.

In addition to being a major tourist attraction for Hong Kong, The Peak is also the summit of Hong Kong's property market. At the peak of The Peak, properties are more expensive than anywhere else in the world. Most of the super-rich in Hong Kong – including Cheung Kong (Holdings) chairman Li Ka-shing and the Kwok brothers of Sun Hung Kai Properties – live in detached houses in Island South or The Peak. In May 2010 a house at Barker Road (where Hong Kong's most expensive residential buildings are located) sold for HK$1.8 billion. At HK$68,228 per square foot, it is the most expensive location in the world. The buyer is Martin Lee, the son of Hong Kong billionaire Lee Shau-kee. On 12 January 2014, a Barker Road property sold at over HK$100,000 (US$13,000) per square foot for HK$690 million. 

Official residences

The Peak is home to a few other key officials in Hong Kong:
* 19 Severn Road – residence of the Secretary for Justice
* Victoria House and Victoria Flats at 15 Barker Road – residence of the Chief Secretary for Administration
* Headquarters House 11 Barker Road – residence of the Commander of PLA Forces in Hong Kong and former home of the Commander-in-Chief of British Forces
* Chief Justice's House 19 Gough Hill Road – residence of the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal

Word Origin and History for Dutch

adj.
late 14c., used first of Germans generally, after c.1600 of Hollanders, from Middle Dutch duutsch, from Old High German duit-isc, corresponding to Old English þeodisc "belonging to the people," used especially of the common language of Germanic people, from þeod "people, race, nation," from Proto-Germanic *theudo "popular, national" (see Teutonic ), from PIE root *teuta- "people" (cf. Old Irish tuoth "people," Old Lithuanian tauta "people," Old Prussian tauto "country," Oscan touto "community").
As a language name, first recorded as Latin theodice, 786 C.E. in correspondence between Charlemagne's court and the Pope, in reference to a synodical conference in Mercia; thus it refers to Old English. First reference to the German language (as opposed to a Germanic one) is two years later. The sense was extended from the language to the people who spoke it (in German, Diutisklant, ancestor of Deutschland, was in use by 13c.).
Sense narrowed to "of the Netherlands" in 17c., after they became a united, independent state and the focus of English attention and rivalry. In Holland, Duits (formerly duitsch) is used of the people of Germany. The Middle English sense survives in Pennsylvania Dutch, name of the people who immigrated from the Rhineland and Switzerland.
Since c.1600, Dutch (adj.) has been a "pejorative label pinned by English speakers on almost anything they regard as inferior, irregular, or contrary to 'normal' (i.e., their own) practice" [Rawson]. E.g. Dutch treat (1887), Dutch uncle (1838), etc. -- probably exceeded in such usage only by Indian and Irish -- reflecting first British commercial and military rivalry and later heavy German immigration to U.S.
The Dutch themselves spoke English well enough to understand the unsavory connotations of the label and in 1934 Dutch officials were ordered by their government to stop using the term Dutch. Instead, they were to rewrite their sentences so as to employ the official The Netherlands. [Rawson]
Dutch oven is from 1769; OED lists it among the words describing things from Holland, but perhaps it is here used in the slighting sense. Dutch elm disease (1927) so called because it was first discovered in Holland (caused by fungus Ceratocystis ulmi).

The Norman Conquests
The Norman Conquests is a trilogy of plays written in 1973 by Alan Ayckbourn. The plays were first performed in Scarborough, before runs in London and on Broadway. A television version was first broadcast in the UK during October 1977.

Outline

The small scale of the drama is typical of Ayckbourn. There are only six characters, namely Norman, his wife Ruth, her brother Reg and his wife Sarah, Ruth's sister Annie, and Tom, Annie's next-door-neighbour. The plays are at times wildly comic, and at times poignant, in their portrayals of the relationships among the six characters.

Each of the plays depicts the same six characters over the same weekend in a different part of a house. Table Manners is set in the dining room, Living Together in the living room, and Round and Round the Garden in the garden. Each play is self-contained, and they may be watched in any order, some of the scenes overlap, and on several occasions a character's exit from one play corresponds with an entrance in another. The plays were not written to be performed simultaneously, although Ayckbourn did achieve that some twenty-five years later in House & Garden.

Production history

The plays were first performed in Scarborough, before a season in London, with a cast that included Tom Courtenay as Norman, Penelope Keith as Sarah, Felicity Kendal as Annie, Michael Gambon as Tom, Bridget Turner as Ruth, and Mark Kingston as Reg.

The plays originally premiered on Broadway in 1975 for 69 performances at the Morosco Theatre, directed by Eric Thompson and featuring Richard Benjamin, Ken Howard, Barry Nelson, Estelle Parsons, Paula Prentiss, and Carole Shelley.

The first major London revival of The Norman Conquests was presented at The Old Vic Theatre in 2008 with Matthew Warchus directing a cast including Stephen Mangan as Norman, Jessica Hynes as Annie, Ben Miles as Tom, Amanda Root as Sarah, Paul Ritter as Reg and Amelia Bullmore as Ruth. The Old Vic auditorium was transformed to a theatre in the round, known as the CQS Space, especially for this production.

The 2008 Old Vic production opened on Broadway with the London cast at the Circle in the Square Theatre on 7 April 2009, official opening 23 April, and scheduled closing on 25 July 2009.  

Television adaptation

In 1977 the plays were adapted for television by Thames Television. Penelope Keith reprised her role as Sarah. The rest of the cast featured Tom Conti as Norman, Penelope Wilton (who had played Ruth in the original 1974 London stage production)  as Annie, Richard Briers as Reg, David Troughton as Tom and Fiona Walker as Ruth. The three plays were directed by Herbert Wise and produced by Verity Lambert and David Susskind. Keith won the BAFTA Television Award for Best Actress for her performance.

Passage:
George Cornell
George Cornell (born George Myers;  – 9 March 1966) was an English criminal and member of the Richardson Gang, who were scrap metal dealers and criminals. He was shot and killed by Ronnie Kray at the Blind Beggar public house in Whitechapel, east London. Kray was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder three years later and remained in Broadmoor Hospital until his death in 1995.

History

Cornell hailed from east London and was originally known as George Myers but had changed his surname some years earlier. Cornell was a tough, loyal enforcer who worked for the Richardson Gang; he was known for being totally fearless. A childhood friend of the Kray twins, Cornell was a prominent criminal in east London during the 1960s and upon moving to South London joined up with the Kray twins' rivals, the Richardson Gang, who were brothers Charlie Richardson and Eddie Richardson.   

Cornell, along with Richardson gang colleague and friend "Mad" Frankie Fraser,  became an enforcer for the Richardsons and was primarily used by them for talks with the Krays. Meetings were often held in pubs such as The Grave Maurice. 

Death

On 9 March 1966, Cornell and his friend Albie Woods entered the Blind Beggar pub, ordered some light ales and then sat upon stools next to the bar. At around 8:30pm, both men were approached by Ronnie Kray; on seeing him, Cornell sneered with sarcasm "Look who's here". Ronnie Kray walked towards Cornell, took out a 9 mm Luger, and calmly shot him once in the forehead, just above his right eye. 

Cornell slumped against a nearby pillar, the bullet, apparently, passing straight through him. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died at around 03:30am. 

The news spread rapidly. Although Ronnie Kray was identified by several eyewitnesses as he calmly left the public house, no one would agree to testify against him and the police were forced to release him from custody. Cornell was buried in Camberwell New Cemetery, south London. 

Old Bailey trial

On 4 March 1969 Ronnie Kray was unanimously found guilty by a jury at The Old Bailey of the murder of George Cornell.  His brother Reggie was also found guilty of murdering Jack McVitie, who was killed the year after Cornell. They were both sentenced to life imprisonment. 

Ronnie Kray died in jail in March 1995, while Reggie Kray was imprisoned for a total of 32 years before he was released from custody on compassionate grounds in August 2000 as a result of cancer, from which he died a few weeks after his release.
Question:
George Cornell was shot by Ronnie Kray in which East End pub in 1966?
Answer:
The Blind Beggar
Passage:
Gridiron (cooking)
A gridiron is a metal grate with parallel bars typically used for grilling meat, fish, vegetables, or combinations of such foods. It may also be two such grids, hinged to fold together, to hold food securely while grilling over an open flame.

Development

Early examples of the gridiron were found in Pompeii. The Latin term is "craticula", a diminutive form of "crates". This referred to their cross-hatched design, which appeared similar to a wicker basket, or crate.  This is also used as the base for the term graticule, passing through French. 

There were numerous iron gridirons manufactured and patented in the U.S. in the 1800s. Originally called spiders, these iron legged devices were used in a fireplace placed over the fire to cook food. Over time, gridirons have been developed specifically to accommodate the type of food being prepared and the cooking method being used. A combination hinged gridiron and spider was developed and patented in 1836 by Amasa and George Sizer of Meriden, Connecticut.  A steel wire gridiron was developed and patented as early as 1889 in New Haven, Connecticut, by William C. Perkins, of the New Haven Wire Goods Co., who received a U.S. Patent #408,136 for a hinged gridiron that would hold the meat in place while broiling.  A commercial hinged broiler or gridiron was designed for use in the Bridge & Beach, Co., 1898 vertical cast iron stove. This hinged broiler was manufactured by Luigi Pieragostini, also of the New Haven Wire Goods Co., and patented in 1939; U.S. Patent #2,148,879. 

Today, hinged gridirons are used extensively to deep fry or broil fast food in restaurants throughout the world. Hotdog gridirons are also available for camping and outdoor cooking.

Cultural references 

Gridirons are essential to Chapter 28 of David Copperfield when David, the Micawbers and Traddles improvise a meal on one.  Dickens mentions them again as a suitable and practical gift for a blacksmith to make for someone in Charles Dickens' book Great Expectations where he refers to their use for cooking small fish known as "sprats".

The American football field resembles a gridiron, which brought up the term "gridiron football".

In Christian iconography the gridiron is an attribute of Saint Lawrence of Rome.

Notes
Question:
Who, because he was roasted on a gridiron, is the patron saint of cooks?
Answer:
Lawrence of Rome
Passage:
Obsolete golf clubs
Early golf clubs were all made of wood. They were hand-crafted, often by the players themselves, and had no standard shape or form. As the sport of golf developed, a standard set of clubs began to take shape, with different clubs being fashioned to perform different tasks and hit various types of shot. Later, as more malleable iron became widely used for shorter range clubs, an even wider variety of clubs became available.

While many of the clubs manufactured between 1901 and 1935 came from Scotland, more and more started coming from larger US manufacturers.

These early clubs had hickory shafts and wrapped leather grips.
To secure the joins both between the shaft and the head of the club, as well as between the grip and the shaft, whipping of black, waxed linen thread was used. Pre-1900 clubs (smooth-faced gutty era) used 7-ply thread. Clubs from the era 1900 to 1935 required 4-ply thread.

From 1924 golf clubs started to be manufactured with steel shafts, pyratone shafts, aluminum shafts, and fiberglass or resin shafts; many of them were given a wood-look coating.  

Woods

Wooden clubs generally had a metal base-plate and were made heavier with a lead-insert into the back of the head; often the face of the club had insert to reduce the wear from impact on the wood.

They were:
* Play club: Driver
* Brassie: so called because the base-plate was of brass; equivalent to a 3-Wood  
* Spoon: Higher-lofted wood; equivalent to a 5-Wood
* Baffing spoon or a Baffy: Approach wood; equivalent to a 7-Wood

These were made of wood and were used until being replaced by the numbered system used today.

Irons

They were:
* Driving iron: 1 Iron 
* Long iron: 2 Iron 
* Mid mashie: 3 Iron 
* Mashie iron: 4 Iron 
* Mashie: 5 Iron 
* Spade mashie: 6 Iron 
* Mashie niblick: 7 Iron 
* Pitching niblick: 8 Iron 
* Niblick: 9 Iron 
* Jigger: Very low lofted iron, shortened shaft - similar to a modern chipper

The traditional set of irons was invented by Archibald Barrie and were used from 1903 up until about the 1940s. The introduction of the standardized numbered iron set produced by the Spalding Sporting Goods Company in the early 1930s caused the traditional set of irons to gradually give way to numbered convention.

The traditional irons varied greatly in loft (+/- 5 degrees). The shape of the head determined some of the playing characteristics of the club; most traditional heads were roughly egg-shaped.

Sabbath sticks

Sunday sticks or sabbath sticks were the golf enthusiasts' answer to the Church of Scotland's discouraging golfing on Sundays. Clubs were disguised as walking sticks, the club head comfortably fitting in the palm of the golfer's hand, until feeling unobserved, the stick was reversed and a few strokes were played.
Question:
In what sport would you use a niblick?
Answer:
Scramble (golf)
