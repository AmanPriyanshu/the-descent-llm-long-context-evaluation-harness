Passage:
Myositis
Myositis is a general term for inflammation of the muscles.  Many such conditions are considered likely to be caused by autoimmune conditions, rather than directly due to infection  (although autoimmune conditions can be activated or exacerbated by infections.) It is also a documented side effect of the lipid-lowering drugs statins and fibrates.

Elevation of creatine kinase in blood is indicative of myositis.

Types

Types of myositis include:
* myositis ossificans
* (idiopathic) inflammatory myopathies
** dermatomyositis
*** juvenile dermatomyositis
** polymyositis
** inclusion body myositis
* pyomyositis
Question:
'Myositis' affects which part of the body?

Baby Love by The Supremes Songfacts
Songfacts
The Motown songwriting team of Holland-Dozier-Holland wrote this innocent song about teenage love. They wrote 14 US Top-10 hits for The Supremes.
Explaining how the trio wrote to NME in 1984, Lamont Dozier said: "I would collaborate with Eddie on lyrics and with Brian on melodies. Then Brian and I would go into the studio and produce the actual record although Eddie should have been put down as one of the producers because he helped teach the artists the tune when the lyric was finished."
A musician named Lorenzo Pack filed a lawsuit against Motown in 1966, claiming the Holland-Dozier-Holland songwriting team based "Baby Love" on his 1962 song "I'm Afraid." Pack had little evidence to support his assertion, and Motown won the lawsuit. The testimony, however, revealed some insights on this song, as Brian Holland told the court: "When we write a song, we try to express real feelings about a real situation. In writing the song for The Supremes it was obvious that we were writing for pretty young girls, of whom one is the so-called lead singer. Therefore, in writing 'Baby Love,' we pictured a simple story about a girl whose boyfriend has left her and who loves him very dearly and who would like the boy to come back.  The music fits this simple story."
This was The Supremes' first and only song to reach #1 in the UK. The Supremes were the first girl-group to have a #1 hit in Britain. It turned out to be The Supremes' only UK #1, though they had many more in the US.
In August of 1974, this song was reissued in Britain, where it reached UK #12. >>

According to Rolling Stone magazine, when this song was finished, Berry Gordy thought it wasn't catchy enough and sent the group back into the studio, which is when they came up with the "Oooooh" at the beginning.
This song, " Where Did Our Love Go " and " Come See About Me " were written by Holland-Dozier-Holland in one session and were all recorded within two weeks. Berry Gordy required the songwriters to punch a clock when they came in and left for work at Motown, which is something he learned working for Ford. The H-D-H team was especially proficient, often completing 2 or 3 songs a day.
This song received a Grammy nomination for Best Rhythm & Blues Recording in 1965; it lost to Nancy Wilson's "How Glad I Am."
This was the second US #1 hit for The Supremes, following " Where Did Our Love Go ." They were the first Motown act with two #1 hits. >>

Passage:
Giant George
Giant George was a blue Great Dane previously recognised as the world's tallest living dog, and the tallest dog ever by Guinness World Records. There were originally conflicting media reports regarding his height, but the official measurement showed that he was three-quarters of an inch taller than the previous record holder, Titan (at 43 in at the withers) and an inch shorter than the subsequent record holder, Zeus.  His records were announced as he appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in February 2010.

Biography

George was born on November 17, 2005, and was owned by David Nasser since George was 7 weeks old.  While measured 42 5/8 inches high (108.3 cm) at the midpoint of the neck and wrongly advertised by Guinness as 43 inches (109.2 cm) at the withers, his legitimate height was 39 1/8 inches (99.4 cm) at the withers according to GPCA Illustrated Standard  and he weighed 245 lb,  which is about 100 lb more than an average Great Dane. At the time of his death, Giant George resided in Tucson, Arizona. 

At home he slept in a queen-sized bed, and one of his hobbies was to ride around his family's neighborhood in a golf cart. While traveling to Chicago for his 2010 appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, George was given a row of three airline seats to himself. He caused a commotion with fellow passengers visiting him to take photographs. "There were so many people coming to the front of the plane, the pilot ended up illuminating the 'fasten seat belt' sign to get everyone to sit down," explained his owner, David. During the flight, George along with David and wife Christine had to sit in the bulkhead, the partition that divides first class from the rest of the passengers. They were to fly first class on American Airlines, but they found that there wasn't enough room for George and instead flew the following day.

George died on October 17, 2013. 

Nomination

Conflicting reports were made of George's height, so a Guinness judge was sent to verify it.  Craig Glenday, Editor-in-Chief of Guinness World Records explained, "This is a hotly contested record and after some controversy and conflicting media reports we decided to send our own official adjudicator to put the final stamp on this record holder." The measurement by veterinarian Jim Boulay and witnessed by Guinness representative Jamie Panas showed that George was three-quarters of an inch larger than the previous record hold, another Great Dane, Titan. 

The records were announced by Oprah Winfrey on February 22, 2010 when George appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show.  George had been awarded the titles secretly on February 15, 2010, with Oprah's producers asking all parties and media to keep the announcement quiet until after his appearance on the show. Inquiries had been made by the show for George to appear prior to him gaining the titles; however, his owner requested that they hold off their appearance until Guinness had reviewed his application. 

The announcement of the new record was used by Guinness World Records to publicize a variety of other pet-related record searches, including longest ears on a dog, smallest dog (length), oldest dog, smallest cat and oldest cat.

Passage:
Dogmatix
Dogmatix is a fictional character, a tiny white terrier dog who belongs to Obelix in the Asterix comics. Dogmatix is a pun on the words dog and dogmatic. In the original French his name is Idéfix, itself a pun on the French expression idée fixe (fixed idea) meaning an obsession. 

Dogmatix is the only animal among the main characters of the series.  His role is minor in most of the stories, significant mainly as a 'bone' of contention between Asterix and Obelix as to whether he should be allowed to accompany them on their adventures. However, he is often doing something interesting in the background and occasionally fulfills an important part of the plot.  In the words of the authors, Dogmatix is the only known "canine ecologist": he loves trees and howls in distress whenever one is damaged. Despite his small size, he is quite fearless. He has drunk the magic potion on a number of occasions, but his favourite treat is to 'chew a bone'.

Dogmatix makes his first appearance in Asterix and the Banquet. He is first seen sitting in front of a butcher's shop in Lutetia, watching Asterix and Obelix go in. He then follows Asterix and Obelix all around Gaul, appearing in nearly every panel of the story until the end.  The two men do not notice him until the very end when he finally attracts Obelix's attention at the closing banquet and is given a pat on the head and a bone. He was meant to be a one-off character (hence his leaving the village in the final picture) but he was so effective that it was decided to bring him back.

In the next adventure, Asterix and Cleopatra he plays a more active role and is given his name. He causes Asterix and Obelix to argue about whether or not he should accompany them to Egypt, but proves his worth by following the Gauls into a pyramid in which they were lost and guiding them out safely.

Like many dogs, Dogmatix is very protective and jealous of his master, especially when he falls for, or is shown affection by, beautiful young women. In Asterix the Legionary he makes very clear his loathing for Panacea with whom Obelix had fallen in love. He shows the same attitude to Influenza in Asterix and Caesar's Gift and Melodrama in Asterix and the Great Divide. However, despite his loyalty to his master, Dogmatix has been shown to side with Asterix in arguments on various occasions, such as in Asterix and the Soothsayer and Obelix and Co.

His friendship with Pepe in Asterix in Spain  and Asterix in Corsica causes Obelix to become very jealous. Likewise, Dogmatix is unimpressed by Obelix's attraction towards Panacea in the earlier stages of Asterix the Legionary and is hostile and growls when his master asks her to look after him while he is away. However, Panacea kisses him straightaway, putting him into a lovestruck daze.

In Asterix and the Actress, he finds a mate and returns with a litter of puppies.

Dogmatix books

Dogmatix's great popularity gave rise to a line of children's books in 1973 featuring his "adventures".  These were in the form of text with illustrations and were not consistent with the Asterix stories.

# Idéfix fait du sport. (Dogmatix the Athlete)
# Idéfix et la petite fille. (Dogmatix and the Little Girl)
# Idéfix au cirque. (Dogmatix at the Circus)
# Une folle poursuite. (The Crazy Chase)
# Idéfix se fait un ami. (Dogmatix Makes a Friend)
# La chasse au sanglier. (Dogmatix and the Boar Hunt)
# L'orage. (Dogmatix and the Storm)
# Un gouter bien merité. (The Well-Deserved Tea Party)
# Idefix et le bébé. (Dogmatix and the Baby)
# Idéfix et le poisson clown. (Dogmatix and the Lost Fish)
# L'anniversaire d'Idéfix. (Dogmatix' Birthday)
# Idéfix à la neige. (Dogmatix in the Snow)
# Idéfix magicien. (Dogmatix the Wizard)
# Idéfix et le perroquet. (Dogmatix and the Parrot)

Although they carry the Goscinny/Uderzo byline, these are licensed works aimed at the children's market. They lack the style and sophistication of the main Asterix creative team, and have little or no editing for continuity. Although widely translated (not by the regular English translators of the Asterix comics), these comics did not become very popular, and are mostly forgotten.

In 1983, an attempt was made to revive the series with two new stories. These were translated by Derek Hockridge and Anthea Bell, who were the regular English language translators of the Asterix albums.

Passage:
It was a dark and stormy night
"It was a dark and stormy night" is an often-mocked and parodied phrase  written by English novelist Edward Bulwer-Lytton in the opening sentence of his 1830 novel Paul Clifford.  The phrase is considered to represent "the archetypal example of a florid, melodramatic style of fiction writing," also known as purple prose.

Origin

The phrase had earlier been used by Washington Irving in his 1809 "A History of New York."  Its status as a catchphrase for bad writing comes from the opening sentence of Bulwer-Lytton's novel Paul Clifford:

Evaluations of the opening sentence 

Writer's Digest described this sentence as "the literary posterchild for bad story starters."  On the other hand, the American Book Review ranked it as #22 on its "Best first lines from novels list." 

In 2008, the great-great-great-grandson of Bulwer-Lytton, Henry Lytton-Cobbold, participated in a debate in the town of Lytton, British Columbia with Scott Rice, the founder of the International Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest. Rice accused Bulwer-Lytton of penning "27 novels whose perfervid turgidity I intend to expose, denude, and generally make visible." Lytton-Cobbold defended his ancestor, noting that he had coined many other phrases widely used today such as "the pen is mightier than the sword", "the great unwashed" and "the almighty dollar", and said it was "rather unfair that Professor Rice decided to name the competition after him for entirely the wrong reasons." 

Later usage

Literature

The Peanuts comic strip character Snoopy, in his imagined persona as the World Famous Author, always begins his novels with the phrase "It was a dark and stormy night." Cartoonist Charles Schulz made Snoopy use this phrase because "it was a cliché, and had been one for a very long time."  A book by Schulz, titled It Was a Dark and Stormy Night, Snoopy and credited to Snoopy as author, was published by Holt, Rinehart, and Winston in 1971. 

It is the opening line (and paragraph) in the popular 1962 novel A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'Engle: 

L'Engle biographer Leonard Marcus notes that 

While discussing the importance of establishing the tone of voice at the beginning of fiction, Judy Morris notes that L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time opens with "Snoopy's signature phrase." 

Music

Joni Mitchell's song "Crazy Cries of Love" on her album Taming the Tiger opens with "It was a dark and stormy night". In the December 1998 issue of Musician, Mitchell discusses her idea of using several cliche lines in the lyrics of multiple songs on the album, such as "the old man is snoring" in the title song Taming the Tiger. Her co-lyricist, Don Fried, had read of a competition in The New Yorker to write a story opening with "It was a dark and stormy night" and was inspired to put it in the song lyrics. Mitchell states 

Board game

In the board game titled It Was a Dark and Stormy Night, contestants are given first lines of various famous novels and must guess their origin. Originally sold independently in bookstores in the Chicago area,  it was later picked up by the online book reading club Goodreads.com. 

Writing contest

The annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest was formed in 1982. The contest, sponsored by the English Department at San Jose State University, recognizes the worst examples of "dark and stormy night" writing. It challenges entrants to compose "the opening sentence to the worst of all possible novels."[http://bulwer-lytton.com/about.htm About The Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest] The "best" of the resulting entries have been published in a series of paperback books, starting with It Was a Dark and Stormy Night in 1984.

Passage:
Nazca Plate
The Nazca Plate, named after the Nazca region of southern Peru, is an oceanic tectonic plate in the eastern Pacific Ocean basin off the west coast of South America. The ongoing subduction, along the Peru–Chile Trench, of the Nazca Plate under the South American Plate is largely responsible for the Andean orogeny. The Nazca Plate is bounded on the west by the Pacific Plate and to the south by the Antarctic Plate through the East Pacific Rise and the Chile Rise respectively. The movement of the Nazca Plate over several hotspots has created some volcanic islands as well as east-west running seamount chains that subduct under South America. Nazca is a relatively young plate both in terms of the age of its rocks and its existence as an independent plate having been formed from the break-up of the Farallon Plate about 23 million years ago. The oldest rocks of the plate are about 50 million years old. 

Boundaries

East Pacific and Chile Rise

A triple junction, the Chile Triple Junction,  occurs on the seafloor of the Pacific Ocean off Taitao and Tres Montes Peninsula at the southern coast of Chile. Here three tectonic plates meet: the Nazca Plate, the South American Plate, and the Antarctic Plate.

Peru–Chile Trench

The eastern margin is a convergent boundary subduction zone under the South American Plate and the Andes Mountains, forming the Peru–Chile Trench. The southern side is a divergent boundary with the Antarctic Plate, the Chile Rise, where seafloor spreading permits magma to rise. The western side is a divergent boundary with the Pacific Plate, forming the East Pacific Rise. The northern side is a divergent boundary with the Cocos Plate, the Galapagos Rise.

The subduction of the Nazca plate under southern Chile has a history of producing massive earthquakes, including the largest ever recorded on earth, the moment magnitude 9.5 1960 Valdivia earthquake.

Intraplate features

Hotspots

A second triple junction occurs at the northwest corner of the plate where the Nazca, Cocos, and Pacific Plates all join off the coast of Colombia. Yet another triple junction occurs at the southwest corner at the intersection of the Nazca, Pacific, and Antarctic Plates off the coast of southern Chile. At each of these triple junctions an anomalous microplate exists, the Galapagos Microplate at the northern junction and the Juan Fernandez Microplate at the southern junction. The Easter Island Microplate is a third microplate that is located just north of the Juan Fernandez Microplate and lies just west of Easter Island.

Aseismic ridges

The Carnegie Ridge is a 1,350-km-long and up to 300-km-wide feature on the ocean floor of the northern Nazca Plate that includes the Galápagos archipelago at its western end. It is being subducted under South America with the rest of the Nazca Plate.

Fracture zones

Darwin Gap is the area between the Nazca Plate and the coast of Chile, where Charles Darwin experienced the earthquake of 1835. It is expected that this area will be the epicenter of a major quake in the near future.Darwin Gap quake will shake Chile again [http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20048-darwin-gap-quake-will-shake-chile-again.html], New Scientist, 30 Jan 2011, accessed 8 Feb 2011.

Plate motion

The absolute motion of the Nazca Plate has been calibrated at 3.7 cm/yr east motion (88°), one of the fastest absolute motions of any tectonic plate. The subducting Nazca Plate, which exhibits unusual flat-slab subduction, is tearing as well as deforming as it is subducted (Barzangi and Isacks). The subduction has formed, and continues to form, the volcanic Andes Mountain Range. Deformation of the Nazca Plate even affects the geography of Bolivia, far to the east (Tinker et al.). It was on the Nazca Plate that the 1994 Bolivia earthquake occurred; this had a magnitude of 8.2 M_w, which at that time was the strongest instrumentally recorded earthquake occurring deeper than 300 km.

Aside from the Juan Fernández Islands, this area has very few other islands that are affected by the earthquakes that are a result of complicated movements at these junctions.

Geologic history

The precursor of both the Nazca Plate and the Cocos Plate (to its north) was the Farallon Plate, which split in late Oligocene, about 22.8 Mya, a date arrived at by interpreting magnetic anomalies. Subduction under the South American continent began about 140 Mya, although the formation of the high parts of the Central Andes and the Bolivian orocline did not occur until 45 Mya. It has been suggested that the mountains were forced up by the subduction of the older and heavier parts of the plate, which sank more quickly into the mantle.

Passage:
Gnomon
A gnomon ([ˈnoʊmɒn], from Greek , gnōmōn, literally: "one that knows or examines"  ) is the part of a sundial that casts a  shadow.  

The term has come to be used for a variety of purposes in mathematics and other fields.

History

Anaximander (610–546 BC) is credited with introducing this Babylonian instrument to the Greeks.  Oenopides used the phrase drawn gnomon-wise to describe a line drawn perpendicular to another.  Later, the term was used for an L-shaped instrument like a steel square used to draw right angles. This shape may explain its use to describe a shape formed by cutting a smaller square from a larger one. Euclid extended the term to the plane figure formed by removing a similar parallelogram from a corner of a larger parallelogram. Indeed, the gnomon is the increment between two successive figurate numbers, including square and triangular numbers.

Hero of Alexandria defined a gnomon as that which, when added to an entity (number or shape), makes a new entity similar to the starting entity. In this sense Theon of Smyrna used it to describe a number which added to a polygonal number produces the next one of the same type. The most common use in this sense is an odd integer especially when seen as a figurate number between square numbers.

The Chinese used the gnomon. It is mentioned in the 2nd century Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art as being used much earlier by the Duke of Zhou (11th century BC).

Orientation

In the northern hemisphere, the shadow-casting edge of a sundial gnomon is normally oriented so that it points north and is parallel to the rotation axis of the Earth.  That is, it is inclined to the horizontal at an angle that equals the latitude of the sundial's location.  At present, such a gnomon should thus point almost precisely at Polaris, as this is within a degree of the North celestial pole. 

On some sundials, the gnomon is vertical. These were usually used in former times for observing the altitude of the Sun, especially when on the meridian.  The style is the part of the gnomon that casts the shadow.  This can change as the sun moves.  For example, the upper west edge of the gnomon might be the style in the morning and the upper east edge might be the style in the afternoon.

A three-dimensional gnomon is commonly used in CAD and computer graphics as an aid to positioning objects in the virtual world. By convention, the X axis direction is colored red, the Y axis green and the Z axis blue.

NASA astronauts used a gnomon as a photographic tool to indicate local vertical and to display a color chart when they were working on the Moon's surface.

In popular culture

In the book The Tower at the End of the World by Brad Strickland,  a giant tower and thin stairs turn out to be the gnomon of a giant sundial. The island the tower is found on is often called "Gnomon Island".

The Gnomon of Saint-Sulpice inside the church of Saint Sulpice in Paris, France, built to assist in determining the date of Easter, was fictionalized as a "Rose Line" in the novel The Da Vinci Code. 

A gnomon is used metaphorically in Charles Portis's novel Masters of Atlantis.

GNOMON is the name of a sentient computer network in the third edition of the role-playing game Unknown Armies

Passage:
Graham Moffatt
Graham Victor Harold Moffatt (6 December 1919 – 2 July 1965) was an English character actor and comedian who was most active in the 1930s and 1940s.

Born in Hammersmith, London, the son of Frederick Victor Moffatt (1896-1977) and Daisy Eleonora nee Whiteside (1895-1969), both of whom outlived him. He was born on 6th December 1919, exactly 31 years after Will Hay whom Moffatt would become famous starring in movies with.  He is best known for a number of films where he appeared with Will Hay and Moore Marriott as 'Albert': an insolent, overweight, overgrown-schoolboy type character, loosely reminiscent of Billy Bunter.

Moffatt had wanted to act from a young age. He had two sisters, one being Rita Doreen Moffatt (1936-1991) and the other living. He originally worked as a call boy at Shepherd's Bush Studios, and often saw actor Tom Walls going in and out of the sound stages. Walls took a liking to Moffatt, and chose him for a bit part in the 1934 film A Cup of Kindness. He then gave up his job as a call boy, and went on to appear in 4 more films in minor, uncredited roles before getting his big break in Will Hay films.

His first film with Will Hay was Where There's a Will (1936) in which he plays an office boy. In his next film with Hay, Windbag the Sailor (1936), he is joined by Moore Marriott and his character has become 'Albert'. He is known by this name in all his later films with Hay and Marriott: Oh, Mr Porter! (1937), Old Bones of the River (1938), Ask a Policeman (1939) and Where's That Fire? (1940). Still as Albert, he appeared again with Moore Marriott in a series of films starring Arthur Askey: Charley's (Big-Hearted) Aunt (1940), I Thank You (1941), and Back Room Boy (1942).

His later films include Powell and Pressburger's A Canterbury Tale and I Know Where I'm Going!, before he semi-retired from show business to become a publican with his wife Joyce Muriel (Hazeldine or Rider) whom he married in June 1948 and remained married to for 17 years until his death in July 1965. Together, they ran the Swan Inn at Braybrooke (near Market Harborough,) followed by The Englishcombe Inn at Bath. He was locally famous for shortchanging his customers. In March 1952 he had to be admitted to hospital in Kettering after two weeks of hiccuping. He still made occasional film appearances until his death from a heart attack in 1965 at the early age of 45. He made his last film appearance in the 1963 film 80,000 Suspects, directed by Val Guest, who was a writer of many of the films that Moffatt starred in with Will Hay and Moore Marriott.  His ashes were scattered at sea.

Howdy,
Ok, so I only started watching Emmerdale in the last year or so for the Aaron storyline.  But I'm confused about which Dingle is related to who and if it's by blood of marriage and what not.
So, does anyone have a family tree for them? Is Cain, Marlon and Chas brothers and sisters? But then Eli is Marlons brother...
And is Zak their dad? But then Shadrach is Chas's Dad, but I'm sure Chas referred to Zak as Aaron's granddad?
So, anyone?

Bloody confusing, that's what!
Cain and Chas are half-siblings, they share the same mother (Faith Dingle), Cain's Dad is Zak, Chas's Dad is Shadders (Aaron's grandad is Shadders).
Eli and Marlon are brothers, sharing the same parents in Albert and Delilah (not the same Delilah as played by Hayley Tammadon, she's not been in the show as far as I'm aware)
Are Cain and Charity cousins?
 
Sorry read that as Chas.
 
Are Cain and Charity cousins?
second cousins by the looks of it
their parents are cousins
second cousins by the looks of it
their parents are cousins
So their relationship is still slightly wrong.
 
Are Cain and Charity cousins?
Charity's father is Obediah Dingle, Zak's cousin, so I'm not sure what that makes them..second cousins?

Passage:
PayDay (confection)
PayDay is a candy bar consisting of salted peanuts rolled in caramel surrounding a firm nougat-like center.  It is currently produced by The Hershey Company.

History

PayDay was first introduced in 1932 by Frank Martoccio. Martoccio founded the F.A. Martoccio Macaroni Company, and also later served as head of the Hollywood Candy Company. Hollywood also produced the ZERO bar.  In 1938, Hollywood moved to Centralia, Illinois. In 1967, the Martoccio family sold Hollywood Brands to Consolidated Foods, which later became Sara Lee. Fire destroyed the Centralia plant in 1980. Production of the PayDay bar continued with help from the L.S. Heath and Sons Company until a new facility could be constructed. In 1988, Hollywood Brands was acquired by the Leaf Candy Company, then later became part of The Hershey Company in 1996

PayDay variations include a Honey-Roasted limited edition in 2003, the PAYDAY PRO, a high protein energy bar in 2005, and the PayDay Chocolatey Avalanche, a chocolate-covered version, in 2007. For a promotion in 1989, PayDays each contained an individually wrapped nickel. 

In popular culture 

A PayDay is mentioned in Cheech & Chong's Ralph and Herbie sketch that appears on the Big Bambu album. Herbie notices that Ralph has sat on something which is stuck in his fur and so pulls it off. Ralph then asks what it was and Herbie says "I think it was a PayDay"
Question:
The PayDay candy bar is composed of peanuts and what other confection?
Answer:
Caramels

The Louvre: Tete-a-tete with Durer - Mad About Paris
Tips and Tools for a perfect visit to the Louvre | Mad About Paris
Tweet
Congratulations. You’ve made it to Paris. You have a few things on your list that you absolutely want to do or to see. I bet a visit of the Louvre is at the top of it. And you are absolutely right. The Louvre is a must, indeed, a city within a city. Not only because of its incredible collection of 35 000 works of art and artefacts, among them the most beautiful masterpieces of Western culture. The architecture and the interiors are breathtaking too.
You will not be alone, halas!
Prepare yourself because you will not be alone! To tell you the truth: every year 8 400 000 visit the Louvre. You do not need to be a mathematician to calculate that, on an average day, 23 000 people will be in there with you. They queue for approximately – I hope you’re sitting comfortably as you read this – 107 minutes.
But do not worry. You do not need to queue at all if you listen to “Mad about Paris”. There a only a few things to bear in mind and your visit will be an amazing experience.
First of all: Never go on national holidays, never on the first Sundays of a month (when the entrance is free) and avoid the slot between 10 and 1 am when everybody else has nothing better to do than visit the number one tourist spot of Paris. Instead, take advantage of the “nocturne”, the late opening on Wednesday and Friday nights when the museum is open until 10 pm. You might not believe it, but on a Friday night, when “tout Paris” is dining out and most of the tourists have already collapsed after a long day of walks and visits, you will have some galleries all to yourself.
Everbody wants to see the Mona Lisa
Not the Salle de La Joconde, of course. Everybody who goes into the Louvre comes to see her: the Mona Lisa. That’s why an intelligent museum director put her in a new, a special gallery to spare the visitors long detours. On their way to the Mona Lisa they will happen across The Winged Victory of Samothrace. Is that by chance? Not at all, it’s on purpose, of course. They want to give you the impression that you have seen all the masterpieces in half an hour – and encourage you to quickly quit the battlefield.
Honestly, standing in front of the Mona Lisa feels like waiting on a New York subway platform at rush hour (except less people take photos there). So ask yourself before you go: Do you really want to see this tiny little painting? Do you need to see her, even if her smile will lose some of its charm behind all those cameras and cell phones? Maybe you are just fascinated by her success, so you’ll have a glance and than head on further. Still, you should know that the whole Denon wing with Italian Renaissance painting will be crowded. And for good reason: Botticelli, Fra Angelico and Lippi, Piero della Francesca and Leonardo da Vinci, they are all there. But strangely there are no crowds in front of Leonardo’s Virgin and Child with Saint Anne. Is the painting any less beautiful? Not exactly. But the VIP-factor is just not as high. And nobody really seems to care about the Titians just hanging on the back of the stand-alone wall, behind theMona Lisa.
The world largest museum
Alone with Durer
You definitely do not need not to tread on other people’s toes for visiting the Louvre for one simple reason: it’s the world’s largest museum. The same day I took the photos of the  Mona Lisa under siege, I was all by myself in front of a self-portrait by Albrecht Durer. Almost noone was admiring the mystical paintings by Georges de La Tour. Ancient Egypt doesn’t interest a lot of people either.
That’s why you absolutely must prepare for your visit. The Louvre website is amazing and very helpful. Have a look at it and decide before coming to Paris what you do want to see. Don’t try to go any more than one or two sections because, as is often the case, less is more. To avoid disappointment, check on the website to see if they are open the day your plan to visit because some galleries are closed on different days. And remember: The Louvre is closed on Tuesdays!
Tips and tricks for visiting
Before I forget: if you don’t like queuing for up 107 minutes, why don’t you go in by the hidden entrance called Porte des Lions , on the side of the Seine? On a busy afternoon in July, I could just walk through there at Porte de Lions, whereas the same day I would have spent at least20 minutes queuing up for a security check under the glass pyramid. Because even if you buy advanced tickets online , which you can do, of course, you will have to queue up for a security check. France seems to be well organized and they make queue people in two lines (one for groups, one for individual visitors) just to make the two lines converge into one a bit further on.
One last thing: forget the glass pyramid. It’s gorgeous to look at. But never waste you time queuing up there only for them to check your bags! Have a coffee in Café Marly instead. And use it, majestically, as an exit.
