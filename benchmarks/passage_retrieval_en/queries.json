In Fortran, parameters are always passed by reference, making it relatively easy to generate the code. However, in languages like Pascal, parameters can be passed by different methods chosen by the programmer (by reference, by value, or by \"name\"). This information is only known at the procedure's definition, which may not be encountered before its invocation. To address this issue, a special construction called a \"forward\" declaration is introduced in Pascal. This allows the compiler to know the parameter's usage before its full definition, enabling code generation without the need for a messy fixup mechanism or multiple passes through the source code.",

This is because the strained structure of the three-membered ring favors sp3 hybridization over sp2 hybridization. The addition of a nucleophile to the carbonyl group in cyclopropanones helps release some of the strain in the small ring, making them highly reactive electrophiles. In larger rings, the stability of hemiacetals is due to entropy and the proximity of the nucleophile to the carbonyl group. The formation of cyclic hemiacetals is more favorable because it involves a single molecule reacting with itself, while acyclic acetals involve the consumption of two molecules. Cyclic hemiacetals also have a higher forward rate of reaction, making them more stable. Many biologically relevant sugars, including glucose, are examples of cyclic hemiacetals.",

When asked about the apparent reversal, GLAAD's executive director explained that they had some concerns but also took into account the broader context of daytime television.

Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker turned down financial assistance to the newly appointed Congolese prime minister, Patrice Lumumba, during his visit to Canada. However, about 1,800 Canadians served as peacekeepers in the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC), providing communication and logistical support. Canadian participation was driven by public opinion rather than government action. The Canadian government refused to provide humanitarian relief to Congolese famine victims in 1961. Two Canadians died and 12 were severely beaten by Congolese forces. These beatings were attributed to mistaken identity, as Canadian personnel were confused with Belgian paratroopers or mercenaries. Canadian forces found the Congolese to be illiterate, volatile, and easily influenced. The Canadian government privately favored President Kasavubu, who was more Western-oriented. Canada's support in maintaining the Congo's territorial integrity earned the trust of Joseph Mobutu, who later visited Canada as the leader of the Congolese National Army.",

He held racist views during his university years, believing that Jews were an inferior race that could only overcome their weaknesses through assimilation and intermarriage with Germans and Slavs. However, in the early 1900s, Ruppin's perspective changed, and he embraced his Jewish identity. He no longer advocated for assimilation but instead believed in the reconstitution of Jews as a separate nation, as proposed by Zionism.

Studies indicate that the mechanism involves subverting the antigen presentation pathways of the innate immune system. The drug or metabolite binds to a host protein to form a non-self epitope, which is then presented to T cells by antigen-presenting cells. This can lead to an attack on the body's own tissues. However, the ability of a drug to induce AGEP is limited to individuals who express specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) serotypes targeted by the drug. The text also mentions that HLA serotypes associated with AGEP have not been identified, unlike for other SCARs disorders. Additionally, a specific T cell receptor variant has been linked to other SCARs disorders but not AGEP.",

They also secured a contract to build cargo ships and increased employment at the yard. In April 1918, the company changed its name to The Hampton Shipbuilding & Marine Railway Corp. By 1918, the submarine chasers were completed, and the shipyard was taken over by Charles H. Tenney & Company. However, the Armistice of 1918 resulted in the cancellation of the contract for cargo ships. The shipyard sold two completed ships and discarded the third. The shipyard was then sold at auction in April 1921.",

The businesses National Carriers and Roadline later merged, operating briefly as National Carriers Roadline before being renamed Lynx Express Delivery Network. Despite this, Lynx Express remained the company's official name, although it was commonly referred to by its shortened version. Eventually, after a reorganization, rationalization of core business interests, and a rebranding effort, NFC plc (formerly National Freight Corporation) merged with Ocean Group plc and became known as Exel.

Arab propaganda claims that Jews want to take over the Temple Mount and destroy Muslim structures, while Muslim leaders, led by Hajj Amin al-Husseini, the mufti of Jerusalem, have been campaigning since 1928 to assert Muslim rights over the Western Wall. Construction ordered by al-Husseini caused disturbances for those wishing to pray at the Wall. Jewish leaders appealed to the British authorities for intervention, but no action was taken. On August 14, 1929, Jewish nationalists marched to the Western Wall, raising their flag and shouting slogans. Rumors were spread that Jewish youths had attacked Arabs and insulted Muhammad, and fliers were distributed urging Muslims to seek vengeance. The next day, hundreds of Muslims converged on the Western Wall, burning prayer books and injuring the beadle. The violence spread to the Jewish commercial area and a young Jew was stabbed to death. On August 22, armed Arab villagers gathered at the Haram al-Sharif, and an inflammatory preacher incited violence against Jews. Inflamed by rumors, the Arabs began to attack Jews in the Old City and burn shops. The first murders of the day are disputed, with claims that Arabs were killed in the Jewish Quarter before rumors reached Hebron where the first murder of a Jewish student occurred.",

Tensions escalated on June 11, 1925, when company police clashed with striking miners, resulting in the death of one miner named Davis. This incident led to further clashes and attacks on company properties. The escalating violence led to the deployment of the provincial police force and Canadian Army to control the situation.

After conquering Xinjiang, they incorporated it into China and celebrated the expansion of territory. The Qing rejected the notion that China only encompassed Han-populated areas, proclaiming that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of China. They used terms like \"Chinese language\" to encompass Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and \"people of China\" to include Han, Manchus, Mongols, and other subjects of the Qing. The Qing promoted the idea of uniting different ethnic groups, emphasizing that they were part of one family within the Qing state. They employed the phrases \"Zhong Wai Yi Jia\" and \"Nei Wai Yi Jia\" to convey the concept of unification. The Qianlong Emperor also critiqued earlier beliefs that only Han people could be China's subjects, stating that this was not the understanding of the Qing dynasty. The term \"China\" was used in foreign communications and treaties with other states and first appeared in a Qing government document in 1689.

There are conflicting accounts regarding the effect of the bullet, with some believing that Nampa was killed months later while hunting, and others suspecting that his death was a result of the wound. Rachel Saint, one of the missionaries, disagreed with this belief and argued that the eyewitnesses supported her perspective. However, there is a prevailing belief among the Huaorani tribe that Nampa died from the wound.

        "input": "The introduction of \"all-steel\" car bodies had a significant impact on car factories and the production of cars. The heavy presses required to make the steel panels were expensive, leading many German auto-makers to purchase car bodies from one factory in Berlin. In France, larger auto-makers invested in establishing their own press-shops to manufacture the bodies. Regardless of where the bodies were sourced, heavy investment was necessary for the dies to make the individual panels, which were often different for each car model. However, once the investment in pressing equipment was made, the production of individual car bodies became faster and cheaper compared to the previous timber-framed carriages. By 1928, a successor to the \"all-steel\" bodied car was being produced at a rate of 400 cars per day, accounting for 30% of the cars produced in France. The challenge for auto-makers and investors was the upfront capital cost and finding ways to finance it over the production cycle. Despite the challenges, producing cars with all-steel bodies proved to be profitable for leading automakers, allowing them to gain market share while smaller competitors struggled. Citroën faced financial difficulties in the years leading up to its 1935 bankruptcy, partially due to the cost implications of being the first European auto-maker to use all-steel bodies. However, with Michelin's ownership, Citroën survived and became one of the leading French car makers until 1974, thanks to their adoption of the \"all-steel\" car body technology.",

It compares this technique to other confocal laser microscopy techniques and explains that two-photon excitation microscopy does not use pinhole apertures for optical sectioning like confocal microscopes do. Instead, the optical sectioning in two-photon microscopy is a result of the point spread function of the excitation, which has a dumbbell-shaped pattern. The concept of two-photon excitation is based on the idea that two lower-energy photons can excite a molecule, resulting in the emission of a higher-energy fluorescence photon. Though the probability of the near-simultaneous absorption of two photons is low, a high peak flux of excitation photons is typically used. The advantage of using two-photon excitation is that it improves the extent along the z dimension, allowing for thin optical sections to be cut. Additionally, the longer wavelength, lower energy lasers used in two-photon microscopy cause less damage to live cells, making it suitable for imaging over longer periods without toxic effects.",

Another viewpoint suggests that Borna may have moved with a group of Timociani settlers to Slavonia. S. Prvanović suggests that Borna was a duke from the Timok-Kučevo region who founded the first Croatian state. M. S. Milojević treats Borna as a Frankish vassal in \"Littoral Croatia\", with holdings in the Timok region. Prvanović also accuses F.

The case began with complaints against St Davids before the death of Bishop Wilfrid in 1115. Urban presented a petition to Pope Calixtus II asserting the primacy of Llandaff over other Welsh dioceses and alleging persecution by Welsh and Norman magnates. The pope issued protections for Urban and papal letters in his support. The case was then referred to Rome in 1127, and Urban traveled there in 1128. Pope Honorius II provisionally ruled in Urban's favor, granting territory to Llandaff diocese. However, the archbishop of Canterbury's involvement was criticized. Another hearing in Rome in 1129 resulted in Urban winning by default since the other parties did not appear. The bishop of St Davids appealed the decision in 1130. Urban's claims faced obstacles at the royal court and Canterbury, and Pope Innocent II was less helpful. The case was ultimately settled by the Anglo-Norman archbishops in England in 1133, and Urban lost. He made a final journey to Rome and died in 1134. Despite losing, Urban's efforts changed the relationship between the papal curia and the church in England, leading to more appeals to Rome from English provincial courts.",

Compositionality states that the meaning of a complex expression depends on the meaning of its parts and its mode of composition, while holism argues that the meaning of expressions is determined by their relations with other expressions in the language as a whole. Peter Pagin identifies three points of incompatibility between these two ideas, including the fact that compositionality suggests the meaning of the parts precedes the whole, while holism suggests the opposite. Pagin also explores the implications of inferential role semantics, a holistic theory of meaning, which suggests that every accepted inference involving an expression becomes part of its meaning. The text raises questions about the compatibility of compositionality and holism and challenges the inevitable consequences of accepting a holistic theory of meaning.",

The book examines the concept of victimhood in American politics and argues that it is often used as a tool by the political establishment to shift blame for failures onto specific groups of people. Cole explores the competing claims of victimhood in contemporary American politics, focusing on issues such as welfare, feminism, racism, and the War on Terror. She highlights how the notion of victimhood can create conflicts and tensions between different social groups. Cole also discusses the conflict between the idea of victimhood and the dominant American political culture, which values individualism and often dismisses claims of victimhood as undeserving. She analyzes the use of anti-victimhood rhetoric by certain figures to discredit those claiming to be victims, as well as the rejection of victimhood by some feminists who see it as a tactic to gain power. The study of victimhood has implications for understanding American politics from the 1960s onwards, particularly in relation to multiculturalism, identity politics, and feminism. The book also explores the use of victimhood rhetoric in shaping policies related to civil and criminal justice reform and the welfare state. Additionally, the author has written about the political use of victimhood and vulnerability in peer-reviewed journal articles.",

One source of information is the Dejma list, which mentions Għargħur in connection with Ħal Samudi. It suggests that during the Middle Ages, Għargħur was likely a small rural community. An abbey was established in Ħal Għargħur during this time, but it is unknown when and why it was abandoned. It is speculated that constant pirate attacks on the village may have led to a decline in population. During these raids, houses were built with secret rooms for residents, particularly females, to hide in. The streets and alleys were also designed in a way to confuse invaders. The pirate raids continued even after Għargħur became a parish. On one occasion, the residents sought refuge in the parish church and vowed to hold an annual pilgrimage to the shrine of Mellieħa if they were unharmed. Since nobody was harmed or enslaved on that occasion, the tradition of the pilgrimage began.",

He suggests that the inhabitants of the British Isles from prehistoric times belong to an Iberian genetic grouping, with similarities to the Basque people. Oppenheimer also proposes that the division between the West and East of England is not due to the Anglo-Saxon invasion, but rather to two main routes of genetic flow after the Last Glacial Maximum. He claims that Celtic languages split from Indo-European earlier than previously believed and that the English language separated from other Germanic languages before the Roman period. Bryan Sykes has also arrived at similar conclusions. The National Museum of Wales, however, notes that early genetic studies have produced unreliable conclusions based on limited samples and outdated assumptions.",

Psyllid products make up a large part of the bell miner's diet, sometimes comprising up to 90% of it. They primarily forage in the canopy, but also descend to the understory. There is a theory that bell miners \"farm\" psyllids by excluding other psyllid-eating bird species from their territory. This theory suggests that bell miners may selectively eat older nymphs or lerps, leaving the nymphs unharmed. The evidence for this theory has been mixed, with some studies supporting it and others not. However, when bell miners are removed from an area, other bird species quickly consume the psyllid colonies that were previously protected by the miners.",

He mentions that the writing style reflects the numerous contributors, with some sections being lively and evocative while others are more dry and rules-focused. Bambra explains that while the book is aimed at World of Greyhawk fans, players of campaigns set in different worlds can still find interest in the new spells, magical items, and monsters. The descriptions of NPCs, deities, and clerics can also be used as templates for similar characters in other campaigns, and the adventures and section on zero-level characters are applicable to any campaign. Bambra suggests that some content may be less appealing to non-Greyhawk players, but it still provides inspiration. He praises the section on avatars but believes it could have been improved by including motivations for deities sending avatars. Bambra finds the information on playing clerics accessible but wishes there was more guidance on their conduct and associated myths. He compliments the section on monsters for its layout and presentation. Overall, Bambra states that Greyhawk Adventures tries to cater to a wide audience, but he feels it spreads itself too thin and adds little to the background of Oerth, the World of Greyhawk setting. However, he acknowledges that the book contains good material and is a useful purchase for those seeking new spells, items, and adventure inspiration.",

        "input": "The text discusses the concept of credit rationing in a market with imperfect information. It cites the seminal work of Joseph Stiglitz and Andrew Weiss, who developed a model to show how credit rationing can be an equilibrium feature of the market. This means that a borrower may be willing to pay a higher interest rate than the lender charges, but the lender may not be willing to lend the extra funds due to lower expected profits.\n\nThe text also mentions that market equilibrium can be further enhanced by competition among lenders. In this case, lenders may be willing to accept higher risks than others, resulting in an equilibrium where borrowers who are willing to accept higher risks or pay higher rates can obtain loans. This can happen because lenders have different policies regarding adverse selection, where they face borrowers with different risk levels (types) without knowing the type of each borrower.\n\nThe main idea behind this equilibrium is that safe borrowers would not be willing to accept a high interest rate because they have a low probability of default and will likely end up paying back a large amount. On the other hand, risky borrowers may accept a higher rate because they have a lower chance of a successful project and lower chances of repayment. In this case, the cost of borrowing, or the interest rate paid, increases to account for the additional risk.\n\nThe text concludes by mentioning that when a lender restricts their lending and keeps rates lower, this assumes limited liability and supports the concept of credit rationing. However, the results mentioned in the text could still hold even with unlimited liability.",

However, he shifted his focus to the public sphere in the 1970s, advocating for the creation of a national literature in post-independence Singapore. His collection of poetry, \"Gods Can Die,\" explored themes related to Singapore's national life. His subsequent anthologies, \"Ulysses by the Merlion\" and \"A Third Map,\" further established his reputation as a national poet committed to expressing a cultural vision for a multicultural Singapore. Thumboo is often referred to as Singapore's unofficial poet laureate due to his nationalistic-themed poems and his promotion of Singapore literature. His poem, \"Ulysses by the Merlion,\" was inspired by Irish mythology and history, particularly the works of W.B. Yeats. Thumboo considers himself a myth-inspired poet and views myths as narratives that provide stability in a multicultural society. The poem has also inspired other Singaporean poets to write their own Merlion-themed verses. A copy of \"Ulysses\" is installed on a plaque near the Merlion statue in Singapore.",

It obtained a separate German sphere of influence in Wituland, within present-day Kenya, in 1885.

With the assistance of the German navy, the company managed to maintain control of Dar es Salaam and Bagamoyo, but in 1889, it had to seek help from the German government to suppress the rebellion. Unable to effectively govern its dominions, the company sold out to the German government in 1891, which then assumed direct rule over German East Africa. The company continued to operate various activities, such as mines, plantations, railways, banking, and minting, until it relinquished them to the German colonial administration and other organizations.

The tooth count varies between species, leading some researchers to question whether they represent different species. Euthecodon typically has four premaxillary teeth, except for Euthecodon arambourgi, which has five teeth with the second one smaller. The forehead boss and raised nares are most prominent in E. brumpti and less developed in E. nitriae or E. arambourgi. The nasal bone is excluded from contact with the nares, and the skull table is small and square-shaped. Older individuals may develop squamosal ridges or \"horns\".",

Starting in the 1950s, fossil fuel companies, such as the American Petroleum Institute and Marcellus Shale Coalition, engaged in lobbying efforts against nuclear power due to perceived threats to their commercial interests. In recent years, large fossil fuel suppliers have launched advertising campaigns presenting fossil gas as a complementary energy source to renewables.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry has also supported environmental organizations with anti-nuclear positions, including donating to Friends of the Earth. Some environmental groups, such as the Sierra Club and Environmental Defense Fund, have received grants from fossil fuel companies. Greenpeace previously advocated for the gradual replacement of nuclear power with fossil gas plants as a backup to renewable energy, but it has since shifted its stance towards grid energy storage.\n\nIn Germany, the Energiewende initiative, which aimed to transition to renewable energy, resulted in a gradual phaseout of nuclear power from 2000 to 2022. However, this led to an increase in fossil gas power production, with imports from Russia playing a significant role. Controversial pipeline projects, like Nord Stream 1, were constructed to meet the growing demand for Russian gas in Germany. Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, it was revealed that Russian lobbying had influenced the anti-nuclear and anti-fracking movements in Germany.",

Eleonore and Wilhelmine were aware of its existence and worked to establish a public succession order. In 1712, Wilhelmine persuaded Count Seilern to give her the document, which she sent to her family's head. They then sought assistance from Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz to negotiate with Charles VI. Eventually, Charles VI recognized the secret succession order in April 1713.

This uracil can occur through spontaneous deamination of cytosine or by the incorrect incorporation of dU opposite dA during DNA replication. The most well-known uracil DNA glycosylase is E. coli UDG. Mammalian cells have four different uracil-DNA glycosylase activities: UNG, SMUG1, TDG, and MBD4. These glycosylases differ in their substrate specificity and where they are located within the cell. \n\nSMUG1 has a preference for single-stranded DNA but can also remove uracil from double-stranded DNA. It can remove various forms of uracil, including 5-hydroxyuracil, 5-hydroxymethyluracil, and 5-formyluracil with oxidized groups at carbon 5. \n\nTDG and MBD4 are specific to double-stranded DNA. TDG can remove thymine glycol when it is opposite guanine and can also remove modified forms of uracil at carbon 5. MBD4 is specifically involved in repairing T:G mismatches that result from the deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine at CpG sites.\n\nIn human cells, TDG and SMUG1 are primarily responsible for repairing U:G mismatches caused by cytosine deamination, while UNG handles the repair of uracil arising from dU misincorporation. MBD4 is mostly involved in correcting T:G mismatches at CpG sites. Mutant MBD4 mice do not show increased susceptibility to cancer or reduced survival, but they do have more C to T mutations at CpG sequences in epithelial cells of the small intestine.",

While some argue that tourbillons never improved accuracy, they are still highly valued by collectors and are often found in premium-priced watches. Swiss luxury watchmakers produce high-quality tourbillon wristwatches that can cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in availability and a slight decrease in prices for basic tourbillon models. Nonetheless, watches with tourbillons are still significantly more expensive than those without. Swiss models typically start at $40,000, while some Chinese models can range from hundreds to nearly $5000.",

The Olmsted Brothers, who were developing a master plan for parks in the city, noted the presence of railroads in the downtown area in 1908. They sarcastically mentioned that the area which later became the site of Expo '74 had already been partially \"improved\" with industrial development. They hoped that Spokane would eventually reclaim the area around Spokane Falls for a park. Over time, Spokane became the site of four transcontinental railroads and regional ones. Union Pacific built their own station on the park's site by 1914. However, having a large number of railroads in the city caused problems, such as restricted access to the Spokane River and noise pollution. The presence of elevated tracks, warehouses, and at-grade railroad crossings led to physical and visual limitations.",

These disparities include differences in the quality of care and overall insurance coverage based on race. The text cites a study that found that blacks receive lower quality care than white individuals. The lower quality of care for minority groups is attributed to factors such as low-income and poverty. The text also highlights the higher death rates for African Americans, particularly in relation to treatable or preventable causes such as heart disease and breast cancer. Additionally, infant mortality rates for African American and Latino infants are 2 to 3 times higher than other racial groups.

Scott and Stephenson also adapted a libretto for Lecocq's operetta Le Petit Duc, impressing the composer enough that he agreed to write new music for the English production. Scott used the pseudonym \"Saville Rowe\" for these works. In addition to his theatrical writing, Scott wrote about his travel experiences, which influenced his creative writing.
